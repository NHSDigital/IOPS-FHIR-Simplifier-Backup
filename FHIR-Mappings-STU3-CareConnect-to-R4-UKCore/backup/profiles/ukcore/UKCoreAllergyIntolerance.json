  "description": "Defines the UK Core constraints and extensions on the AllergyIntolerance resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve allergy information.",
  "purpose": "This profile allows a record of a clinical assessment of an allergy or intolerance; a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have an adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance. \r\nWhere a propensity is identified, to record information or evidence about a reaction event that is characterised by any harmful or undesirable physiological response that is specific to the individual and triggered by exposure of an individual to the identified substance or class of substance. \r\nSubstances include but are not limited to a therapeutic substance administered correctly at an appropriate dosage for the individual; food; material derived from plants or animals; or venom from insect stings.",
