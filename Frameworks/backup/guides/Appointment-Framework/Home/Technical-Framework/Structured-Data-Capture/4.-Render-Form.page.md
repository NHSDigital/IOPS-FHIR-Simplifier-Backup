A software supplier will normally build a form/application which implements this Questionnaire definition. 
It is useful to view what this would look like before this development takes place and this will allow feedback on the form.

The NLM/LHC has a useful application for doing this. 

[NLM LHC Questionnaire Viewer](https://lhncbc.github.io/questionnaire-viewer/)

You will need to supply the Questionnaire to this app. We will use a different version of the Vital Signs questionnaire which has been converted to use UK SNOMED CT {{pagelink:Home/Artefacts/Questionnaire/Vital-Signs-Findings.page.md}}.

For this Questionnaire the url is: 

`https://3cdzg7kbj4.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/poc/events/FHIR/R4/Questionnaire/0d9fccea-9c98-4e61-b3e0-bc9b3a9db675`

The `id` which is the last part of this url can be found in the stored Questionnaires on the {{pagelink:Home/Artefacts/Demonstration-Server}}. E.g. When we searched for `https://example.fhir.nhs.uk/Questionnaire/VitalSignsFinding` the response contained an entry like

```
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "https://3cdzg7kbj4.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/poc/events/FHIR/R4/Questionnaire/0d9fccea-9c98-4e61-b3e0-bc9b3a9db675",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
        "id": "0d9fccea-9c98-4e61-b3e0-bc9b3a9db675",
```

The `id` field is the id we need to use.
