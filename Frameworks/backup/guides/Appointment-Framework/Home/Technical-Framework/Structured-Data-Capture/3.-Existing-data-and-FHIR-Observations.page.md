The previous section described how a form was completed and then stored/sent to a FHIR Server or recipient. This capability will obviously reduce time spent completing forms.

For example: A Questionnaire which asks for the patients weight will query an EPR data source for the data via a query like [GET /Observation?patient=073eef49-81ee-4c2e-893b-bc2e4efd2630&code=27113001&date=gt2022-02-15](http://lb-fhir-facade-926707562.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Patient%20Demographic%20Queries/get_FHIR_R4_Patient)
This returns any body weight observations in the specified time period.

The person completing the form may enter in a new body weight, in this case a body weight Observation should be stored in the EPR so that it can be reused in the next form. This is done by calling [POST /QuestionnaireResponse/$extract](http://lb-hl7-tie-1794188809.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Structured%20Data%20Capture/post_FHIR_R4_QuestionnaireResponse__extract) which will return a FHIR Transaction contain FHIR Observation which can then be used to add the Observations to an EPR server.

These two concepts are described in 

- [Form Population](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html) which uses a FHIR Questionnaire to automatically retrieving existing patient data as a pre-populated FHIR QuestionnaireResponse.
- [Form Data Extraction](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/extraction.html) which processes a completed FHIR QuestionnaireResponse into a FHIR Observations for storing on an EPR Server.


### Demonstration Application 

The US National Library of Medicine has produced a [Structured Data Capture Demonstration](https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/lforms-fhir-app/?server=https://3cdzg7kbj4.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/poc/events/FHIR/R4) of this process. This link is configured to use this `UKCore Reference Implementation` and can be configured to use other FHIR Servers. Servers will need to implement the following interactions

| Interaction | Description |
|--
| [GET /metadata](http://lb-hl7-tie-1794188809.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Security%20and%20API%20Management/get_FHIR_R4_metadata) | To interegate the servers capabilities. The application will alter its behaviour based on the interactions supported. **Required** |
| [GET /Patient](http://lb-fhir-facade-926707562.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Patient%20Demographic%20Queries/get_FHIR_R4_Patient) | To search for Patients. **Required**  |
| [GET /Questionnaire](http://lb-hl7-tie-1794188809.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Structured%20Data%20Capture/get_FHIR_R4_Questionnaire) | To retrieve forms definitions. **Required** |
| `GET /Questionnaire/$populate` | To automatically populate a FHIR QuestionaireResponse. This endpoint is not currently supported on the UKCore server and so the app uses `GET /Observation` instead. |
| [GET /Observation](http://lb-fhir-facade-926707562.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Diagnostics/get_FHIR_R4_Observation) | To support automatic population of form data. | 
| [POST /QuestionnaireResponse](http://lb-hl7-tie-1794188809.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Structured%20Data%20Capture/post_FHIR_R4_QuestionnaireResponse) | To store the completed form **Required** |
| [POST /QuestionnaireResponse/$extract](http://lb-hl7-tie-1794188809.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Structured%20Data%20Capture/post_FHIR_R4_QuestionnaireResponse__extract) | Processes the completed form and converts answers into FHIR Observation (in a FHIR transaction format) when required |  
| [POST /](http://lb-hl7-tie-1794188809.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/swagger-ui/index.html#/Batch%20Record%20Transfer/post_FHIR_R4_) | To store a series of Observations in a FHIR transaction Bundle |
