- [VULCAN Retrieval of Real World Data for Clinical Research](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vulcan-rwd/) In the context of clinical research, Real World Data (RWD) are data created in the “real world” of everyday experience, such as a routine patient visit to a healthcare provider, as opposed to data created under clearly defined protocols typical of controlled clinical trials. The primary purpose for such data, collected for a purpose other than use in a clinical trial, is in support of clinical care of patients and knowledge for their healthcare providers. However, large amounts of such information could potentially be used for the secondary purpose of supporting clinical research to analyze the data and generate supporting evidence for, as an example, a new indicated use for an already approved pharmaceutical drug or safety-related analyses. The identification of outcomes, safety signals, or other research/regulatory insights demonstrated with the use of RWD is commonly called Real World Evidence (RWE).
