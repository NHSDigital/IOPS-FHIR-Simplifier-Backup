The process definitions and guidance at this stage become more complex and descriptions can be found in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidance:

- [Type 2 diabetes in adults: management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng28)
- [Type 1 diabetes in adults: diagnosis and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng17)

An overview diagram of NICE Guidance: Type 2 diabetes in adults: management is shown below:

The process and workflow around diabetes management has become significantly more complicated. We do however start to see processes starting to repeat:

- Self-monitoring is similar to the self monitoring in the {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Wellness.page.md}} section.
- Processes to arrangement treatment for the complication is likely to be similar to {{pagelink:Home/Artefacts/ServiceRequest/Diabetes-Prevention-Programme-Referral.page.md}} section. 
- Processes to arrange diagnostic tests can be a variation of the treatment processes.

Similar patterns can be seen in [NHS England - Transformation Directorate: Digital playbooks](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-playbooks/)

- Scenarios around self-monitoring, virtual treatment, remote monitoring, etc, have similarities to the self-monitoring introduced in the {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Wellness.page.md}} section.
- Communication and Care Coordination are common themes which overlaps with the communication (and workflow) focus we discussed in the previous sections.

### Diabetes Secondary Care Pathways

These patterns continue in [Get It Right First Time - Diabetes Workstream](https://gettingitrightfirsttime.co.uk/medical_specialties/diabetes-workstream/) 

E.g.

in the emergency department](

### Community Wound Care Management

IT IS POSSIBLE THESE TWO PATHWAYS FIT TOGETHER. It is not clear but MDFT (multi-disciplinary footcare teams (MDFTs)?) may imply the same multi-disciplinary care shown below. (Diagram below is a gist of an NWR form NHS England South-East (IoW and Hamps.))
