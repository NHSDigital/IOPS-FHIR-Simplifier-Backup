?? IS THIS ELABORATING THE TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK - MOVE TO TF?

The previous sections which provided examples of multiple pathways on a patient's journey introduced a host of coordination and communication interactions between citizens/patients, practitioners and providers.

The amount of information and the method of communication varies considerably. Starting with simple verbal communication to large transfers of information especially around interactions between Secondary and General Practice. These interactions will often be called `transfer of care` and/or `referrals`

Also on later stages of the patient journey we start to see multiple pathways occurring concurrently. For example `Imogen` use case involved care from these providers often at the same time:

- General Practice
- Community Care
- Mental Health
- Social Providers
- Secondary Care

There are several solutions which are discussed in {{pagelink:Home/Technical-Framework/Workflow}}
