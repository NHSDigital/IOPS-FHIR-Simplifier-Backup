The Nursing Process is a generalised description. More detailed descriptions can be found in Clinical Pathways which help define the Patients Journey across health and care. They also provide a tool for defining and standardising Clinical Process. 

For example, in the diagram below we have created an example diabetes prevention pathway based on definitions and pathway elaboration from:

- National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) https://www.nice.org.uk/
- NHS England Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) https://gettingitrightfirsttime.co.uk/
- FuturesNHS https://future.nhs.uk/
- Diabetes UK

**Note: Frameworks will not define pathways, any diagrams shown are for illustration purposes only**

Clinical Pathways will often involve several providers, all working on the same problem (e.g. reduce risk of diabetes). The interactions to coordinate the delivery of care is called **workflow** and this will be covered within this project.
