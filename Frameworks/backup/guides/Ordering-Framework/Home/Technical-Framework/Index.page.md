### People, Process and Technology

{{render:diagrams-CareProcess-ppt}}

This approach is aligned to [UK Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles) in particular.

- Technical Frameworks are based on existing common patterns in use in health and care (**Design with data**) which support clinical pathways and processes (Start with user needs) which spread over several care settings (**Understand context**)
- Existing services (**Design with data**) may indicate a mix of interoperability standards (solutions/frameworks may not be HL7 FHIR based)
- Care Coordination will take a pragmatic approach to the data model, this is likely to lead to a simple data model (**Do less**)
- We need to be open to health and care providers issues, and provide support, we should not be hiding our support (**Do the hard work to make it simple and Make things open: it makes things better**)
- This will not be delivered in one go and may take time (**Iterate. Then iterate again**)
- We aim to improve consistency, not standards **Be consistent, not uniform** 


### Principles

- Data is shared as default, data is not sent. This allows all people involved in a patients care to view records, sending is typically between one or two providers.
- Pragmatic. Frameworks will focus on practicality, it will not focus solely of data standards which have often been complex.
- Generic and Pathway focused. Frameworks will align to common requirements or issues on multiple pathways. 
- Open and Collaborative. 
- Start Small and Evolve.
