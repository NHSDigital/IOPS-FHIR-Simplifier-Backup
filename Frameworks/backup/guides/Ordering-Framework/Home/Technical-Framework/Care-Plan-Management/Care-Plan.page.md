- [IHE Dynamic Care Planning (DCP)](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Dynamic_Care_Planning_(DCP)) The Dynamic Care Planning (DCP) Profile provides the structures and transactions for care planning, creating, updating and sharing Care Plans that meet the needs of many, such as providers, patients and payers. Care Plans can be dynamically updated as the patient interacts with the healthcare system. FHIRÂ® resources and transactions are used by this profile. This profile does not define, nor assume, a single Care Plan for a patient.
