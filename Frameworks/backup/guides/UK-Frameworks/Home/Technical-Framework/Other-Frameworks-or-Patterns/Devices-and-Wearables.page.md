- [HL7 FHIR Personal Health Device Implementation](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/phd/index.html) This Implementation Guide (IG) defines the use of FHIR resources to convey measurements and supporting data from communicating Personal Health Devices (PHDs) to receiving systems for electronic medical records, clinical decision support, and medical data archiving for aggregate quality measurement and research purposes. PHDs are typically consumer devices designed to be used by people without medical background. These devices are often used in the home and/or on the patientâ€™s person and are a key element in any remote patient monitoring program. In most cases there is a Personal Health Gateway (PHG) that handles the PHD communications. The PHG translates the PHD data to the appropriate form and uploads it to the receiving systems. Uploads generated by Continua compliant PHGs shall use this implementation guide when transforming the PHD data to FHIR resources.
