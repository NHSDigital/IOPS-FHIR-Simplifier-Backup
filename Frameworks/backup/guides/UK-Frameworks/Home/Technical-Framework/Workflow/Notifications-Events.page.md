<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-information"></i>Notifications should not be used for workflow events. Workflow events include actions for the recipient, notifications are for synchronisation and notifications.</div>

Standards for notification events can include: 

- [Multicast Notification Service API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/multicast-notification-service#overview--overview) Publish and receive patient-related state changes from a single centralised system.
- [FHIR Cast](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhircast-docs/) FHIRcast synchronizes healthcare applications in real time to ensure the user acts on the same clinical information across these applications.
- [FHIR Subscription](http://hl7.org/fhir/subscriptions.html) Topic-Based Subscriptions Framework (Note this is a **FHIR R5** description which is more mature than FHIR R4, options exist to apply this concept to earlier versions.)
