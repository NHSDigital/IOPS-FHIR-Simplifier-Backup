How these services are configured to deliver care is not currently know but it is expected to include a mix of health and care providers (and wider?) and so we know these pathways require interoperability standards support. For example a (Diabetes) Foot Care Management pathway has been elaborated by NHS England SE in conjunction with Hampshire and Isle of Wight ICB. In the diagram below the Medication Therapy is likely to be supported by Electronic Prescription Service (EPS). Note this pathway may follow on from pathways in other care settings (see NICE Diabetic foot problems: prevention and management)
