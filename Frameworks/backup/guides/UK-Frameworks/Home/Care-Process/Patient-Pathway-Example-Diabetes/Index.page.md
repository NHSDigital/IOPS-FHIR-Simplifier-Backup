This section covers demonstrates how `Frameworks` can be used on a `patient journey or pathway`. This will include use existing programmes both local government (public health and social services) and the NHS (primary care, mental health, community and secondary care) where they are applicable. 

The use cases in this section are all centred Diabetes use cases but also apply to other concerns or conditions.
Later stages of this journey, where the patient has a diabetes condition (and other conditions) and multiple care providers is covered in 
{{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Clinical-Pathways-and-Workflow}}


Each of the following sections takes a different perspective to the problem. 

| Section | Perspective | 
|--
| {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Wellness.page.md}} | People |
| {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Diabetes-Concern--NHS-Health-Check.page.md}} | People (Citizen/Practitioner) |
| {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Diabetes-Risk-Evaluation.page.md}} | People (Citizen/Practitioner) and Process | 
| {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Diabetes-Prevention-Programme-Referral.page.md}} | People (Citizen/Practitioner), Process and Technical |
| {{pagelink:Home/Care-Process/Patient-Pathway-Example-Diabetes/Diabetes-Referral-and-Complications.page.md}} | People (Citizen/Practitioner), Process and Technical |

In reality each stage would include

`people + process + technology`

perspectives but to illustrate the problem and how they interact we have chosen to introduce each perspective one by one. 

Focusing on one or two only is very likely to lead to implementation issues and so is not recommended. 
For example, many interoperability solutions (using HL7 v3/CDA/FHIR Messaging and other technical standards) create dataset/record transfer focused solutions which tend to ignore people + process communication and coordination. The modern (FHIR) RESTful approach to handling this dataset/record requirement is **sharing records at source** and this is discussed in {{pagelink:Home/Technical-Framework/Query-API}}.
