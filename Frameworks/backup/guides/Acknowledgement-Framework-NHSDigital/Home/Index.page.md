# Acknowledgement Framework FHIR R4 Implementation Guide

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i><b> Important:</b> The Acknowledgement Framework is early in its development and therefore must NOT be used in any production systems. </div>

The Acknowlegdment Framework aims to become a generic and agnostic solution that will support any future healthcare system using any transport method. We envisage to promote this to be used for projects that will use FHIR R4 in the future.

The Acknowledgement Framework is in a draft state of development so please contact the <a href="mailto:interoperabilityteam@nhs.net?subject=Acknowledgement Framework">IOPS Team</a> if your product or programme would be interested to discuss this potential solution.

Please raise any feedback against this Implementation Guide by clicking <a href="https://simplifier.net/Acknowledgement-Framework/~issues">here</a>.

## Use Cases

- GP Registration - Patient registers online to join a GP practice
- Galleri Pilot - Receive bio-sampling test results
- Other use cases can be included in the near future
