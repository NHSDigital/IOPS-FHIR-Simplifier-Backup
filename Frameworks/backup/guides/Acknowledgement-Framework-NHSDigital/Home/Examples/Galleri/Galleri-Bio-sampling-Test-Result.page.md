<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i><b> Important:</b> The Acknowledgement Framework is early in its development and therefore must NOT be used in any production systems. </div>

### Background

These are a collection of use case examples specific for the Galleri Pilot programme. This includes positive and negative acknowledgement responses. This is to illustrate how the generic and agnostic Acknowledgement Framework can support a specific project use case.

This use case uses the Messaging paradigm within FHIR.

## Use Case Examples

**As** NHS England (GPS)<br />
**I can** send an acknowledgement to GRAIL<br />
**So that** I can acknowledge receipt of the test results
