Please contact the <a href="mailto:interoperabilityteam@nhs.net?subject=Acknowledgement Framework">Interoperability Standards Team</a> if you are interested to discuss this solution for your use case.</div>

The overall design of the Acknowledgement Framework follows a set of key principles. 

# Design Principles

The Acknowledgement Framework is<br /><br />
- **Generic** - Able to be adopted by any product, service or programme within NHS Digital. There will be no profiling, coding, or processes that mention, related or support one particular product, service or programme.<br />
- **Agnostic** - Able to be used for any mode of transport and within any FHIR R4 paradigm. <br />
- **Readable** - Aim to be understood by technical and non-technical stakeholders.
