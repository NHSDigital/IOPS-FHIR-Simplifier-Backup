<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i><b> Important:</b> The Acknowledgement Framework is early in its development and therefore must NOT be used in any production systems. </div>

The overall design of the Acknowledgement Framework follows a set of key principles. 

# Design Principles

The Acknowledgement Framework will be...<br /><br />
**Generic** - Able to be adopted by any product, service or programme within NHS Digital. There will be no profiling, coding, or processes that mention, related or support one particular product, service or programme.<br />
**Agnostic** - Able to be used for any mode of transport and within any FHIR R4 paradigm. <br />
**Readable** - Aim to be understood by technical and non-technical stakeholders.
