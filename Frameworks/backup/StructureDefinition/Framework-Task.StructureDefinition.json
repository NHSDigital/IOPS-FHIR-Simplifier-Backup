        "definition": "FHIR Task usage and scope is defined as \r\n\r\n> A task resource describes an activity that can be performed and tracks the state of completion of that activity. It is a representation that an activity should be or has been initiated, and eventually, represents the successful or unsuccessful completion of that activity. Note that there are a variety of processes associated with making and processing orders. Some orders may be handled immediately by automated systems but most require real world actions by one or more humans. Some orders can only be processed when other real world actions happen, such as a patient presenting themselves so that the action to be performed can actually be performed. Often these real world dependencies are only implicit in the order details.\r\n\r\n**A Task resource often exists in parallel with clinical resources.** \r\n\r\nFor example, a Task could request fulfillment of a ServiceRequest ordering a Procedure that would result in a Procedure, Observation, DiagnosticReport, ImagingStudy or similar resource. Another example would be a Task that requests fulfillment of a CommunicationRequest to be performed between various actors.",
        "comment": "Task has three main uses: \r\n\r\n- basic delivery of an order resource (e.g. MedicationRequest or ServiceRequest)\r\n- minor workflow requests (e.g. phone patient, complete form or validate a referral)\r\n- workflow support (centred around complex workflow support and may involves a workflow engine)\r\n\r\n##### Order Fulfilment\r\n\r\nCentres on the fulfilment of the order. It does not contain the order details which are held in a referenced request resource. \r\nIn the diagram below the recipient or fulfiller of the order uses FHIR Task to accept or reject the order, it also uses Task to send `event` updates. \r\nNote the fulfiller will use other resources to record the details of the fulfilment such as MedicationDispense for a MedicationRequest.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/NHSDigital-FHIR-ImplementationGuide/master/Diagams/Task-Deliver.PNG\" width=\"60%\"/>\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n| Task.code | Task.status | Task.focus | Task.requester | Meaning | \r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| fulfill | rejected | MedicationRequest | dispenser | The dispenser is rejecting the fulfilment/deliver of a referenced MedicationRequest. The MedicationRequest is not cancelled |\r\n| fullfill | cancelled | MedicationRequest | any | The requested fulfilment of the MedicationRequest is cancelled. The referenced MedicationRequest is not cancelled |\r\n| fullfill | accepted | MedicationRequest | dispenser | The dispenser is taking responsibility of fulfilling the referenced MedicationRequest. |\r\n| fullfill | completed | MedicationRequest | dispenser | The requested fulfilment of the MedicationRequest is completed. The referenced MedicationRequest can now be changed to completed. |\r\n\r\nSee the section on `status` for more details.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Minor Workflow Requests\r\n\r\nThis is used to implement additional around an order or to record specific workflow requests. These may not have a focused resource reference. It is anticipated they are coded using SNOMED CT.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/NHSDigital-FHIR-ImplementationGuide/master/Diagams/Task-Action.PNG\" width=\"60%\"/>\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n| Task.code | Task.focus | Task.requester | Task.owner | Task.reasonCode | Meaning |\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n| 413292001 Assessment for referral | ServiceRequest | referrer |  clinician | 3457005 Patient Referral | Check the referenced referral is valid. |  \r\n| 182836005 Review of medication |  | clinician | GP | 151715009 Emergency admission, asthma  | Request to review medication following an emergency admission. |  \r\n| 103742009 Renewal of prescription | MedicationRequest | patient | GP |   | Request for a reissue/refill of a medication |  \r\n| 324861000000109 Review of patient laboratory test report | DiagnosticReport | consultant | |   | Request for a lab report to be reviewed. See also <a href=\"https://nhsconnect.github.io/CareConnectAPI/engage_poc_uhscc.html\">UHS Lab Reports</a> | \r\n\r\nThe Task.status can be used to indicate fulfilment/delivery status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n##### Workflow Support\r\n\r\nMore advanced workflow is supported, this adds in the use of Task.input and Task.output. This allows the passage of inputs and outputs which may be found in automated workflow activities.\r\n\r\nThe diagram below is from an acute trusts handling of a received eRS referral request. Each process communicates via the FHIR Task, the first process takes the eRS referral and gets the referral letter from eRS, these are then passed to the clinician for triage. Once triaged, the clinician creates a book appointment Task which the admin's action.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/NHSDigital-FHIR-ImplementationGuide/master/Diagams/Task-automated.PNG\" width=\"60%\"/>"
