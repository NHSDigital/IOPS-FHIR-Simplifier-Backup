The most common method for these referrals appears to PDF's exchanged via NHS email. \n\n The definition of the activities, plans, forms, etc used during pathways are likely to be defined by each NHS National and/or Provider service. This `PlanDefinition` is a basic overview of these pathways which indicates possible interactions and types of information is being shared or exchanged. \n\n Many of the referrals are pre-defined forms or word templates. \n\n For external referrals it is recommended to make use of both `FHIR Structured Data Capture` and `FHIR Workflow` to provide basic automation support for this process. The will also include the use of `documents` if `FHIR Structured Data Capture` is not used. \n\n For internal referrals, the use of existing HL7 v2 ADT is anticipated. Suppliers being asked to support these interactions should consider following [HL7 v2 ITK (using pipe and hat format only)](https://github.com/NHSDigital/NHSEngland-FHIR-ImplementationGuide/blob/master/documents/HSCIC%20ITK%20HL7%20V2%20Message%20Specifications.pdf), Acute Trusts should be able to transform to this via their Trust Integration Engine.\n\n The report which is returned to the refer at the end of this pathway ideally would be a `FHIR DiagnosticReport` with an included PDF Attachment, please see [Supplementary Remote Monitoring Data from a Virtual Ward Stay - Draft Implementation Guidance](https://github.com/nhsengland/virtual-wards-draft-standards/blob/main/README.md) for more details.",
