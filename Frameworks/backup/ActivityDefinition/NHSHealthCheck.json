  "description": "The NHS Health Check is a health check-up for adults in England aged 40 to 74. It's designed to spot early signs of stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or dementia. As we get older, we have a higher risk of developing one of these conditions. An NHS Health Check helps find ways to lower this risk.",
  "usage": "The check is for people who are aged 40 to 74 who do not have any of the following pre-existing conditions: \n\n - heart disease \n - chronic kidney disease \n - diabetes \n - high blood pressure (hypertension) \n - atrial fibrillation \n - transient ischaemic attack \n - inherited high cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia) \n - heart failure \n - peripheral arterial disease \n - stroke \n - currently being prescribed statins to lower cholesterol \n - previous checks have found that you have a 20% or higher risk of getting cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years. \n\n If you're in the 40 to 74 age group without a pre-existing condition, you should receive a letter from your GP surgery or local council inviting you for a free NHS Health Check every 5 years. You can also call your GP surgery to book a Health Check. You may want to try this online [Heart Age test](https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-heart-age).",
