The guidance is for most standard use cases of presenting elements in consumer applications (envisaged to be implemented for mobile interface). 

The guidance does not prohibit other specific use cases, but appropriate assessment is encouraged. Furthermore, it may be updated in the future to be more specific to known use cases. Support from the programme team will be available to consumers with alternative use cases to assist them with understanding the available data and applicability to alternative presentation. This is to provide appropriate information from which consumers can make their own hazard evaluations and develop their own clinical safety case.</p>


Each element will have two associated headings:

1. Safe to display to patient/citizen.

2. Useful to display to patient/citizen.

            <td>To be used/displayed with caution via PFS. This is not meant to reflect the significance of the element - there may be elements that are highly important to use. The use with caution icon should not be a deterrent, but to state there is great significance on guidance that should be followed to ensure it is viewed safely and not creating user (patient/citizen) hazards.</td>
