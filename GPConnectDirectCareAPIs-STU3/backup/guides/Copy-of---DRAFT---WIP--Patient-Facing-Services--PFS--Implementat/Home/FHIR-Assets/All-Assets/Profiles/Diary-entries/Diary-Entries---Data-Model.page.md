<b>Note</b> - Diary entries are <u>not</u> considered clinically safe to share with citizens via PFS. Diary entries imply that a clinical action ought to be taken in the future, it does not mean it will be or has been. Additionally, if they get marked as complete, it does not necessarily mean that the action was taken. It means that the need to do the item gets ticked off (not that it was done). The ambiguity around diary entries is considered a high risk and should not be shown via PFS.â€‹
