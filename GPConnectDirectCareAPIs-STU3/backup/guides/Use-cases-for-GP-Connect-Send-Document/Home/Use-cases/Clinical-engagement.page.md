To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, GP Connect has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use.

This engagement has included:

- general practitioners
- GP nurses
- GP pharmacists
- practice managers
- GP practice administration staff


The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the use case for the Send Document capability.

New Use Cases have been submitted by Consumer Suppliers working with commissioning organisations and  Health Care Settings that want to use the send document functionality and these have been  discussed within the clinical input group for Direct Care APIs / GP Connect prior to assurance.
