<span class="nhsd-a-tag nhsd-a-tag--bg-light-red">CURRENT VERSION</span>

The previous version of the GP Connect Send Document specification had individual use-case requirements (for assurance) baked into the specification itself, which meant the version had to be incremented with each new use-case (even if the underlying payload had not changed).

This accompanying guide was created to prevent this from happening going forward.
