## {{page-title}}

<p>These pages outline the differences in cardinality between data elements in the PCDS, and the same elements in GP Connect FHIR Profiles. Any data elements that exist in GP Connect Profiles, and are not listed below, have the same cardinality in the PCDS.
The changes listed in this section all fall into, at least one and potentially a combination of, the below categories for each element: 

- PCDS accepts more than one entry 
- PCDS accepts only one entry
- PCDS accepts at least one entry

There are cases where the PCDS does not use some elements within certain GP Connect profiles, where this is the case it has been listed below the differences in the table </p>
