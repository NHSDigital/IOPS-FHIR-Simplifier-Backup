The long-term goal is that once this standard is complete, GP’s and suppliers will be able to use this standard as a way of ‘connecting’ to each other accurately without a loss of data and decrease time of the migration process.

<p>Below is a diagram showing some data elements from the PCDS:</p>

<p>Please note this is just an example and not all data elements are shown.</p>

An up-to-date version of the full data model representation can be found on the [NHS GitHub repository](https://github.com/NHSDigital/gp-interop-dms/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file). Please be aware that the PCDS aims to be aligned as near as possible to the GP Connect Data Model. However, there are some changes that have been made since this is a separate project and these are reflected within this guide, and the previously referenced data model.
