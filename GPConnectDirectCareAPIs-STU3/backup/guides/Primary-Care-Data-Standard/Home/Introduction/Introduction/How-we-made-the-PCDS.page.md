This diagram shows step-by-step the processes of how we made the PCDS. 
## Ordered Lists
1.	Research the specific use-cases for each data standard and how it can relate to the PCDS.
1.	Using each example data standard in step 1, go through each profile, e.g. allergies, go through the GP data model, define the cardinality, data types and FHIR target and then add the needed SNOMED codes, or NHS data dictionary, and then we compare it to the other standards. 
    a.	Sometimes we started with CIS data model and then compared it to the GP Connect data model.
1.	First internal review with the team.
    a.	Reviewing the data
    b.	Accurate FHIR types
    c.	Accurate data types
1.	Second review is sign off by clinicians, data experts, etc. Similar review points of step 3.
1.	Getting it through front door teams, etc.
1.	Publishing the standard.
