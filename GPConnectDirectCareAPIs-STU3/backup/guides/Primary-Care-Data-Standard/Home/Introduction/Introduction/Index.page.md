This page will explain what the Primary Care Data Standard (PCDS) is and its purpose. 
<p>The main goal for the PCDS is to ensure consistency, help ease the interoperability and boost efficiency across GP systems for a migration. 
This workstream is dedicated to the production and maintenance of the PCDS with the support of the operational data to help bridge the gap between supplier-to-supplier migration for a GP.</p>

<p>To date, weâ€™ve explored key areas including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>data format specifications</li>
    <li>stakeholder consultations for data requirements (including pain points)</li>
    <li>reviewed existing standards for alignment</li>
</ul>

<p>We have used a combination of the Professional Records Standards Body (PRSB) and GPConnect/CareConnect FHIR Profiles to produce this standard.</p>

### Problem Statement
There is no human readable standard that describes the requirements of what should be stored & shared in a GP record for everyone to understand.
