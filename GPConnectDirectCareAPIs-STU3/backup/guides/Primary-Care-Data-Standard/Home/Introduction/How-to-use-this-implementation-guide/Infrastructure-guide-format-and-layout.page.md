## {{page-title}}

<p>This table shows you the purpose and intended audience of the sections and pages within the guide. The intended audience
    tells you the type of reader the page is primarily aimed at, but it does not exclude other
    types of reader from reviewing and feeding back to the team producing the implementation guide.</p>
<p>Note: not all pages described in the table will be present in every implementation guide as the content is dependent
    on things such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>how the information is exchanged (which FHIR paradigm used RESTful, Messaging, Document, and so on)</li>
    <li>whether Clinical headings are used in the exchange of the information</li>
    <li>which FHIR assets are used in the information exchange</li>
    <li>the type of information that is being exchanged</li>
</ul>
