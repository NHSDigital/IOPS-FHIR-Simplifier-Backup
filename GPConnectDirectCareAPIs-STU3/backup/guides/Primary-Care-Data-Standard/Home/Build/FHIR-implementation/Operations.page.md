[Operations](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/operations.html) are used (a) where the server needs to play an active role in formulating the content of the response, not merely return existing information, or (b) where the intended purpose is to cause side effects such as the modification of existing resources, or creation of new resources.

As outlined in the [Extend and Restricting the API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/profiling.html#api) section of the FHIR® standard, NHS Digital has decided to prefix its operation names with a short prefix (for example, `gpc`) followed by a ‘.’ to reduce the likelihood of name conflicts.
