The MESH Client is an alternative means which organisations use to send and receive messages from the MESH central server infrastructure.

When using this automated means of message routing, the `To_DTS` field in the MESH message control (`.ctl`) file must be populated according to the same syntactic conventions described for the MESH API above.
