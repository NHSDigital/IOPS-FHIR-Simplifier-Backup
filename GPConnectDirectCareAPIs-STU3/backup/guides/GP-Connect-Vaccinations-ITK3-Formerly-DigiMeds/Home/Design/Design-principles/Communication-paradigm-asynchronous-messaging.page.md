With the choice of an asynchronous communication paradigm, the natural choice for transport was MESH, which is the strategic platform already in place to support the asynchronous messaging needs of the NHS.

MESH (and its predecessor DTS) is a proven platform which has successfully supported NHS messaging requirements for a number of years. One of the main benefits MESH brings is excellent reach.

MESH connectivity has already been implemented widely across the NHS and, importantly, is already built into support message flows incoming to GP practices in all GP core clinical system implementations.
