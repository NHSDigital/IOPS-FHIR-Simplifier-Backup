GP system suppliers have implemented rich workflow solutions to enable management of incoming healthcare events. Frequently, these incoming events result in the creation of tasks with associated workflows, which are assigned in a flexible and configurable way by each practice to suit their particular requirements. These solutions provide options for practices to define how this information is treated according to message type and content - enabling the definition of rules to automate the application of updates where this is deemed appropriate.

Senders of healthcare events frequently follow business processes which include a requirement that the target organisation not only acknowledges receipt of the message, but also includes expectation of notification of workflow events which cannot immediately be generated upon message receipt.

Therefore, the approach taken to facilitate updates to GP principal clinical systems originating outside the practice has sought to align closely with these existing practice workflow capabilities and requirements.
