In designing a payload to meet a particular use case, care has been taken to design the payload in such a way that it may be re-used to fulfil other identified use cases through configuration change only.

For example, the Send Consultation Report use case makes use of the more general payload type Send Document. Should a future use case arise where a document needs to be sent, the same payload can be re-used.
