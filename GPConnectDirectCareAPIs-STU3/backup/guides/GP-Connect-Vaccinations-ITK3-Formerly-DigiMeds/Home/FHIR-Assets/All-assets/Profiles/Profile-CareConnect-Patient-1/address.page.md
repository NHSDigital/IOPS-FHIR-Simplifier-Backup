It is expected that the `address` element will **NOT** be included when sending a document, as demographic data should be held within the Personal Demographic Service; however, there _could_ be a use case for this information, if the receiver were perhaps to print and send the document to a patient's registered address in the Personal Demographic Service.

    <b>Warning</b>: The use of this element is outside of the current intended scope for this capability. Care should be taken by the sending system if this element is used, to ensure the accuracy of the address being populated.
