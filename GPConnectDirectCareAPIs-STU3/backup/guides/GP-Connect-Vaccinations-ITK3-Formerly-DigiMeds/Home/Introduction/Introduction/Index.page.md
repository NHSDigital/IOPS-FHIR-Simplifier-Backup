## {{page-title}}

This specification enables the sharing of documents using [ITK3](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/interoperability-toolkit-3-messaging-distribution-fhir-standards), [Care Connect FHIR API standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/care-connect-fhir-standards) (based on STU3), and [MESH](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh).

FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within England’s health and social care systems.
