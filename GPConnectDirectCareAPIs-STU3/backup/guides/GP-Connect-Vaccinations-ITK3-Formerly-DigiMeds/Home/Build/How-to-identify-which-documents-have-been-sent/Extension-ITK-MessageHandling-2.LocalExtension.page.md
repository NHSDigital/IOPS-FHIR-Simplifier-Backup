Previous versions of the GP Connect Send Document specification stated this the `LocalExtension` element in the {{pagelink:Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Extensions/Extension--Extension-ITK-MessageHandling-2}} profile must be populated.

Since `v2.0.0`, this requirement has been deprecated, and the default value is `None`.

It **MUST NOT** be used to identify the document that has been sent.
