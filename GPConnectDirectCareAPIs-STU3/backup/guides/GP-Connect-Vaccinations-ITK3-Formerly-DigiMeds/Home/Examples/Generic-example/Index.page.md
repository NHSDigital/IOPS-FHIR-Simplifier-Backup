    <strong>Note</strong>: The wireframe below is for illustration purposes, and is intended to to provide a visualisation the sort of fields could be displayed within a PDF.
</div>

The branding could be that of the provider system (rather than the NHS logo), and some headings may not be applicable for the type of document being sent. The aim of having a wireframe / template is so that the cognitive load on the clinical / administrative staff is reduced, with relevant information being accessable.

The types of data that is expected to be common across all use cases (and should be contained within the PDF) are:

- document title
- version (if supported)
- page number x of y
- citizen / patient information
- sender information
- the intended recipient of the PDF
- date and time of the activity / event
- logical headings representing the information being presented
