To meet strategic objectives to improve access to GP care, this API enables patients (through a consumer application, such as the NHS App) to view and manage their permissions to their medical record and a selection of services provided at their GP practice. The permissions and access a patient can have are defined, set, maintained and controlled by the GP practice through their GP supplier system.

The API, specifically when getting a patient's permissions, also performs the function of enabling a patient's online access and setting their default permissions, should they not already have online access enabled. This is detailed in {{pagelink:Home/Design/New-online-patient-access}}.
