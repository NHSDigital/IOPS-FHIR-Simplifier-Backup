### Default permissions

When a patient has online access activated they should have the default permissions applied as defined by the GP practice. If the practice has [Accelerated Access](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-guidance-for-gp-practices/guidance-on-nhs-app-features/accelerating-patient-access-to-their-record) turned on then the patient should receive full access to their current medical record. Access to the historical medical record will continue to be the same level of access as set in the patient record. This is often the summary view of the medical record.

The act of activating online access for a patient does not determine the permissions they receive. The permissions available to a patient are determined by the practice's defaults. The practice is in control of the permissions a patient has.
