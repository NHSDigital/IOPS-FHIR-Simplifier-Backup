The scope of the API is to deliver functionality that will enable a patient facing application e.g. the NHS App to:

- display to the patient only features and functionality the patient has access to
- show the patient the permissions they have to their medical record and a selection of services provided at their GP practice
- provide the ability for the patient to request changes to the permissions they have to their medical record and a selection of services provided at their GP practice

This functionality is provided by a single endpoint (`/Patient/{id}`) and two [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) i.e. [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) and [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST). Additional information is available on [NHS Digital's API catalogue](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/gp-connect-patient-facing-user-permissions) and within this guide for both {{pagelink:Home/Build/How-to-get-a-patient-s-permissions}} and {{pagelink:Home/Build/How-to-request-a-change-to-a-patient-s-permissions}}.
