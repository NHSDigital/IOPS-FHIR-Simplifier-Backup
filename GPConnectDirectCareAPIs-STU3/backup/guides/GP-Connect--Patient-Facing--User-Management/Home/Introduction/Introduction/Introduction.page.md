GPIT Futures programme's main vision is to accelerate and extend data access to patients in an efficient way. Part of that accelerating work is the patient facing services (PFS) which would enable seamless access of data for patients from Foundation System (FS) suppliers.

The overall design of PFS is based on providing access to PFS APIs implemented by existing and New Market Entrant (NME) Foundation System suppliers. Access to the PFS APIs would be managed through API Management APIGEE gateway managed by NHS England.
