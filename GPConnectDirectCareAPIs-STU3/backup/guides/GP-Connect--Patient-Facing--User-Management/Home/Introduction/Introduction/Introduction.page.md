GP Connect's vision is to accelerate and extend data access to patients in an efficient way. Part of that accelerating work is patient-facing services (PFS), which enable seamless access of data for patients from Foundation System (FS) suppliers.

The overall design of PFS is based on providing access to PFS APIs implemented by existing and new market entrant (NME) Foundation System suppliers. Access to the new consumer PFS APIs would be managed through NHSD API Management Apigee gateway.
