The enablement team can help get you started by guiding you in the following:

##### 1. Confirming the GP Connect (Patient Facing) User Permissions capability fulfils the use case requirements

Read through this specification to ensure that it fulfils the requirements for your use case, and that the sending or receiving system(s) can meet the data requirements - for example, having the information required to populate the user permissions API response as described in this specification.

##### 2. Submit your use case for the User Management capability

Contact [gpconnect@nhs.net](mailto:gpconnect@nhs.net) about your use case for the User Management capability.

##### 3. Getting your use case approved

Use cases are approved on the basis that development is started for the capability approved within six months. If this date is missed, then a review of the case will be required.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <b>Important:</b> Additional development will require a new use case submission.
</div>

##### 4. Getting conformance

Once approved, the service practitioner will:

- introduce the assurance process and artefacts to gain technical conformance
- set up a Microsoft Teams page which will be used to raise queries

<div class="alert alert-info nhsd-t-body" role="alert">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> Complex or unique use cases are taken to a weekly board for approval.
</div>

##### 5. Assurance

The developed solution will require assurance before it can be enabled in production.
