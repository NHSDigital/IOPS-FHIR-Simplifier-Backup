There is a single main use case available from the user permissions API using the `POST` HTTP request method i.e. requesting a change to a patient's permission. This can be further broken down into the following three cases:

1. requesting additional access to the appointments
1. requesting additional access to the prescriptions
1. requesting additional access to the medical record
