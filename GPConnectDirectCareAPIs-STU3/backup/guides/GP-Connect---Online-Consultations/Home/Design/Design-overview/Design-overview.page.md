When a patient completes an online consultation it is necessary for information from that online consultation to be sent to the appropriate care provider, such as the patientâ€™s registered GP practice or a community pharmacy. This ensures the information is available to the care provider to give appropriate care to the patient.

This specification outlines how to send data between an online consultation and a community pharmacy.
