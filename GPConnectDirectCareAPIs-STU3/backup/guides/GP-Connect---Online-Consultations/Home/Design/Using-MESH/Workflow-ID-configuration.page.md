All messages which are sent to MESH specify a Workflow ID which identifies the workflow a particular data transfer is part of.

Each GP Connect Messaging use case will be associated with a single Workflow ID which has been created for use with messages generated by that use case only.

Where the use case requires some form of ITK acknowledgement, an additional Workflow ID will be created to be used for acknowledgement messages generated for the use case.

Please refer to the applicable messaging use case details page for information on the Workflow ID to be used when generating particular messages.
