To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, GP Connect has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use.

This engagement has included:

- general practitioners
- GP nurses
- community pharmacists
- practice managers
- GP practice administration staff

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the business process and user stories.
