This section describes the steps/actions involved in the Online Consultation Report use case where a online consultation is written within the OC system and is sent to the consumer system either at the patient’s registered GP practice or an alternative care provider (for example, a community pharmacy).

---

The following process flows have be investigated and mapped out:

1. Online Consultation auto triage to an alternative care provider - the OC system has the ability to auto triage based on the information entered by the patient. The OC system makes the decision to send to an alternative care provider (in this case a community pharmacy).
2. Online Consultation auto triage to GP - the OC system has auto triaged the OC and made a decision to send back to the patient’s registered GP practice.
3. Online Consultation manual triage to GP or an alternative care provider - the OC system has workflow functionality and OCs are worked on in the system. A decision is then made manually to either send the OC back to the patient’s registered GP or to forward to an alternative care provider (in this case a community pharmacy).
