    <b>Important</b>: The preferred method for sending documents is via the MESH API. This is because the MESH API is more easily integrated into sending systems.<br /><br />The MESH client can be used to send the message, but the MESH API Address Lookup is still required if sending to an alternative care provider.<br /><br/>Message routing to registered practice can be used if only ever sending to the patientâ€™s registered GP practice.
