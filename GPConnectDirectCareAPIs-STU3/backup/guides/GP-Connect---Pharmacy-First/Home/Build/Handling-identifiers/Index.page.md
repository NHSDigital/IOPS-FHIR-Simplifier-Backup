This specification has attempted to promote as much re-usability as possible by using the GP Connect Data model (STU3 representation) - that is, the same model as Access Record: Structured - but with ITK3 as the vehicle to transport the data around.

There are, however, some differences around identification between the two that need to be addressed.
