Access Record: Structured prefers the resource name followed by the identifier for identification - a process which tends to be more performant, as well as easier to read for a human.


For example:

- `Patient/17e54bea-340a-46ff-a765-08816a1e2e74`
- `Encounter/6125a4f6-50f7-4ae6-955a-44ca44a99864`
- `Practitioner/583fdceb-05df-484a-a1b1-ef148cf5e13e`

This approach is preferred going forward; however, it cannot be harnessed while using ITK3.
