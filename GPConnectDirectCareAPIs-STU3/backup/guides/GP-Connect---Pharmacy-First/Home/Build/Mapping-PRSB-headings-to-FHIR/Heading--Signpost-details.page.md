> These are the details of any services that the person has been signposted too. Signposting is in the form of providing the person with the name of an organisation and their contact details - for example, telephone number, website (it is not a referral).

<div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--bg-light-blue nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6 nhsd-t-body">
  <b>Note</b>: The concept of signposting within the PRSB is relatively new and not yet fully understood well enough to be mapped to FHIR in a structured fashion.
  <br />
  <br />
  As such, <b>free text is preferred</b> to record the signpost details in this version of the specification.
</div>

**Example**

<button class="nhsd-a-button active" onclick="openTab(event, 'XML View')">XML</button>
<button class="nhsd-a-button nhsd-a-button--outline" onclick="openTab(event, 'Table View')">Table</button>

<div class="example" class="nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6">
