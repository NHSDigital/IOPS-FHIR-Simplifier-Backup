All references to medication must use the NHS standard of dm+d. The dm+d concept class used will give different levels of specificity, as required by the prescriber.

The most generic medication instruction would specify a dm+d Virtual Therapeutic Moiety (VTM) plus a dosage instruction.

The most specific medication instruction, for the purposes of prescribing, would specify a dm+d Actual Medicinal Product (AMP) plus a dosage instruction.
