Healthcare organisations often use different software and different words, or 'terminologies', to record health information: what one doctor records in their system as a 'chest infection', for example, might be recorded as 'upper-respiratory infection' in another, so the two systems might not be able to match the information up.

A terminology server transforms the way in which data is captured, shared and analysed across health and care, meaning more effective, efficient and safer decision-making. This makes providing healthcare services, treatment and cures more efficient and cost-effective.

It also makes it possible to load local codes and map these to national codes, or other local or system codes.
