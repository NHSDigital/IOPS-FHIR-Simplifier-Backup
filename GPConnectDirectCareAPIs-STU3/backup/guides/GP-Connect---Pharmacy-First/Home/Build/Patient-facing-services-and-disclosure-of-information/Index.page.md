Parts of the GP record may be visible to a patient within patient-facing services such as the NHS App.

The NHS App enables a parent, family member or carer to provide access services using [linked profiles ](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-help-and-support/linked-profiles-in-the-nhs-app/) (also referred to as 'proxy access').

It is possible for a patient to request to a healthcare professional (such as a pharmacist) that they do not want individuals with proxy to be able to access some/all of their information about the care they have received - for example, if discussing a sensitive issue.

The meta.security element within any profile can be used to pass this information across with a simple code NOPAT which will inform the GP that the information received should not be disclosed to anyone else without the provider or patient authorisation.
