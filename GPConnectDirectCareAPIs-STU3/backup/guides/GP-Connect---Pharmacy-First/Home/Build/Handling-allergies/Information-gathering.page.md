Pharmacists proactively gather patient allergy information using tools like GP Connect and the Shared Care Record. When these tools are not accessible or do not contain a complete allergy history, pharmacists will directly document the patient's reported allergies within their clinical system.

Where possible, pharmacists will record the following information in the clinical system:

- **Type of reaction** (e.g., anaphylactic, rash, nausea)
- **Causative agent** (e.g., penicillin, peanuts, latex)
- **Date the reaction was identified**
- **Description of the reaction** (free text)
- **Severity** (e.g., severe, moderate, mild)
- **Certainty** (e.g., confirmed, suspected, possible)
- **Date of first experience**

This comprehensive documentation helps ensure accurate and informed patient care.
