The `Observation.category` element within the Observation resource can be used to articulate the classification of type for the observation.

The [code system](https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r3.core/3.0.2/files/58207) contains numerous codes; however, this specification will only make use of the following:

### Social history

The Social History Observations define the patient's occupational, personal (e.g. lifestyle), social, and environmental history and health risk factors, as well as administrative data such as marital status, race, ethnicity and religious affiliation.

### Vital signs

Clinical observations measure the body's basic functions such as such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, height, weight, body mass index, head circumference, pulse oximetry, temperature, and body surface area.
