These types of observations will only contain a code - typically SNOMED, and will not contain a value.
For example: pregnancy status, or to indicate that an Ambulatory blood pressure recording has been declined.

There are only a few scenarios where this will be the case, and the {{pagelink:Home/Build/Mapping-PRSB-headings-to-FHIR}} page provides examples of these.
