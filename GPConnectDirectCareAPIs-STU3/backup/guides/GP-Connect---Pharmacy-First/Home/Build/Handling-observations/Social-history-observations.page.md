These types of observations may contain an `Observation.valueCodeableConcept` - for example, feeding statut so the baby - or, a value may not be provided at all - for example, smoking status.

There are only a few scenarios where this will be the case, and the {{pagelink:Home/Build/Mapping-PRSB-headings-to-FHIR}} page provides examples of these.
