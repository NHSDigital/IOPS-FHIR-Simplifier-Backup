As of Wednesday, 22nd November 2023, Section 4.18 of the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-pharmacy-contraception-service/">NHS England Pharmamcy Contraception Service specification</a> states the following:

> 4.18 For COC, a supply will require BMI and a blood pressure measurement to be taken in line with NICE guideline 136. A person accessing the service may also offer their own weight, height and blood pressure measurements. Any self-reported measurements that the pharmacist has deemed clinically suitable, will need to be recorded as such.
