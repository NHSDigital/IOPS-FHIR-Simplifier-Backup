As of Wednesday, 22nd November 2023, Section 4.18 of the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-pharmacy-contraception-service/">NHS England Pharmamcy Contraception Service specification</a> states the following:

> 4.18 For COC, a supply will require BMI and a blood pressure measurement to be taken in line with NICE guideline 136. A person accessing the service may also offer their own weight, height and blood pressure measurements. Any self-reported measurements that the pharmacist has deemed clinically suitable, will need to be recorded as such.

Care should be taken when recording these elements to ensure that accurate information is both being stored in the Pharmacy Record, and in the message that flows back to the GP - including correct SNOMED code usage.
