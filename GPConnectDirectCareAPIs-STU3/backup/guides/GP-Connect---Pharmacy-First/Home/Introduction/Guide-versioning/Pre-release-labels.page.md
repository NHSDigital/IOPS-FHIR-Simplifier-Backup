These labels will be taken from the [Government Digital Services development process stages](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery), and will be one of:

- **Discovery**: A Feasibility study. A 'No code' development. Designed to find out what users are trying to achieve, any constraints, improvement opportunities.

- **Alpha**: Develop prototypes and test with users. Could be minimal functionality and potentially prototypes for any options to determine which is best.

- **Private Beta**: Working version and test with invited users. Handle real transactions and work at scale. ‘Invite only’ or regional. Must Pass assessment by business and technical SMEs.

- **Public Beta**: All users can participate. Version unlikely to change substantially, but still needs further testing by a wider group of implementers before becoming live.

- **Live**: The live phase is about supporting the service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements.

- **Retiring**: Implementers notified that the service is discontinued and not to be used for new developments.
