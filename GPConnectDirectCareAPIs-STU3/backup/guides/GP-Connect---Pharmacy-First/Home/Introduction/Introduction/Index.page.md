## {{page-title}}


This specification enables the updating of the patient's GP record using [ITK3](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/interoperability-toolkit-3-messaging-distribution-fhir-standards), [GP Connect data model](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home?version=current) (based on STU3), and [MESH](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh).

FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS England and use GP Connect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within England’s health and social care systems.
