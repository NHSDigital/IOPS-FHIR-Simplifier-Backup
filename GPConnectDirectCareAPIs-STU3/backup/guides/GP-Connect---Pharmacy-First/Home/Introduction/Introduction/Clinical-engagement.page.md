To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, Direct Care APIs has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use.

This engagement has included:

- general practitioners
- pharmacists
- practice managers
- GP practice administration staff

The initial use case for this specification will be for data flowing between Community Pharmacy, and GP systems, for the following services:

- Blood pressure service
- Contraception service
- CPCS Minor illness (including the common conditions extension) service
