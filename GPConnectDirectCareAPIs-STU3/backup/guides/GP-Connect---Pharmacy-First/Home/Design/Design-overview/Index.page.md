The GP Connect Update Record (ITK3) capability provides a simple and standardised means of sending a structured payload between community pharmacy, and GP practice. Each message sent using this capability makes use of the GP Connect Messaging components, MESH, and ITK3 to deliver the message.

All messages sent using this capability will be FHIRÂ® Messages, defined as a FHIR composition, constructed to meet the ITK3 standard and have a specific payload structure.

Initially, this capability will support the Pharmacy First Initiative for the following use cases:

- CPCS Minor Illnesses (including Common Conditions)
- Blood Pressure Check Service
- Contraception
