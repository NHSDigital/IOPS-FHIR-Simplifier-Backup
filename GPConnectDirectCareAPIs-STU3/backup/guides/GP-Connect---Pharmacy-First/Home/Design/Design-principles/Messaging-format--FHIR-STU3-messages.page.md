The HL7 FHIR Message framework was chosen as the messaging format.

HL7 has defined FHIR STU3 as a standard to enable interoperable on-the-wire communication of healthcare data. Within the FHIR STU3 standard, a framework is defined for the exchange of healthcare information in an asynchronous messaging scenario - the HL7 FHIR Message Framework. This, therefore, was a natural choice for the message format, and aligns with the approach taken by the ITK3 Message Distribution Standard.
