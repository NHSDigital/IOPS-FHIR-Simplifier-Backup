The Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) code system shoud be used in preference to SNOMED where possible since:

1. UCUM is per FHIR standard
2. UCUM units are scalar, that is - software can know there are 1000 milliliters in 1 litre, where as SNOMED units are flat.

    <b>Note</b>: Invalid units of measure may be rejected by the consumer (receiving) system.
