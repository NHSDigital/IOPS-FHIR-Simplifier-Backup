The `RecipientType` element **MUST** be set to a value taken from FHIR ValueSet [ITK-RecipientType-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/ITK-RecipientType-1).

The meaning of `RecipientType` is applied in a common way across all ITK3 messaging. 

- `FA` ("For action") means the recipient has been sent the payload for action. The action required by the recipient will be either explicit in the payload or there will be a business rule defined. In this case, "FA" indicates that the recipient is expected to take the action of attaching the payload contents to the patient record. 

- `FI` ("For information") means that no action is required by the recipient and they may process the payload as they see fit.

    <b>Important</b>: GP systems currently ignore the value in this element and as such, all messages are handled as "For action", regardless of which value is populated.
