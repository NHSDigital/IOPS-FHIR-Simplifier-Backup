All GP clinical systems (Providers) must have a mechanism of preventing data being visible to patients / citizens with online record access. This is generally known as data redactions.

Inside clinical sections (e.g., Allergies or Medications) are elements (not to be confused with FHIR elements. They can be coded or free text). Redactions allow GPs or permitted health care professionals (HCP) to redact existing or new clinical records from GP clinical systems. Elements recorded as redacted are not displayed to patients / citizens via PFS. 

Patient access to any element of their record is subject to appropriate safeguards. These are designed to ensure that access to records 

- Does not cause harm to the patient

- That legal confidentiality obligations for the non-disclosure of third-party information are adhered to. 

<br/>

Before record access is switched on all the data that the patient will see should be checked for sensitive data that needs to be redacted. 

Examples MAY include, but are not limited to:

- Groups of elements e.g. an entire consultation

- Individual elements e.g. a code, a medication
