This specification enables the sharing of documents using [Care Connect FHIR API standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/care-connect-fhir-standards) .(based on STU3)

FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within England’s health and social care systems.
