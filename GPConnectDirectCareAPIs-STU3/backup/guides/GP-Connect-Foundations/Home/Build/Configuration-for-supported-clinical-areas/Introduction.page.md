The Access Record Structured capability requires the ability to configure the availability of clinical areas in a Provider system. In the event that a clinical area isn’t available, information for other clinical areas that are configured to be available would still be retrievable. This is required to support the following scenarios:

- to manage First of Type implementations - one or more clinical areas that still require development and/or assurance could be turned off to accelerate the deployment of clinical areas that have been developed and assured
- managing clinical safety incidents - when FRA has been awarded, one or more clinical areas could be turned off if there was a clinical safety incident relating to them

Also, in addition to the [enablement](#Enablement), the Access Record Structured capability requires that one or more clinical areas can be turned off at individual sites.
