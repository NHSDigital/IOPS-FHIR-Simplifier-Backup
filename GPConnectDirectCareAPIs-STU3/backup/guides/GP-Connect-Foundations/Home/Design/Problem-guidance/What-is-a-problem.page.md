A "Problem" is a concept supported by all the GP clinical systems that allows a clinician to identify/highlight specific clinical items in the medical record to describe the status of the patientâ€™s health.

Any clinical item can be identified as a problem, though the method of doing this varies between GP clinical systems.

Examples of possible problems:

- Anxiety with depression
- Swollen legs
- Hypertension
- Blood pressure recorded by patient at home
- Atrial fibrillation
- Knee pain
- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Lives alone

As well as highlighting an item, the problem record also links that item to all the other information in the patient record that describes what has happened in regard to that item. For example, the problems record highlights that the patient has hypertension. It also shows how the hypertension was identified, what discussions have taken place with the patient about their hypertension and what treatments and medication the patient is on to help manage their hypertension.

To support this, problems are linked to:

- every consultation where the problem has been discussed or information about the problem has been recorded
- every clinical item in the patient record that a clinician has identified as relevant to the problem (for example, test results, medication)
- every other problem in the patient record that a clinician has identified as relevant to the problem
