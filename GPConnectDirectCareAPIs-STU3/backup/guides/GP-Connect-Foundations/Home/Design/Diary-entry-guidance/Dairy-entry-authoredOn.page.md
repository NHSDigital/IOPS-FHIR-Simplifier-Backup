<p>The diary entry <code>authoredOn</code> is the date the diary entry was captured on the GP clinical system.
There may also be a consultation referenced which may have occurred on a different date.
Consumer systems which display an originating date for the diary entry (that is when the need for the action was determined) <strong>SHOULD</strong> give the consultation date primacy.</p>
