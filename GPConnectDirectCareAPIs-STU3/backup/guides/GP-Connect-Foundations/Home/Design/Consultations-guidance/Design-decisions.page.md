Systems which allow direct recording of data outside of consultation contexts should not fabricate consultations to return such data when consultation queries are received.

To do so would be generating information and structure which does not exist on the source system, and which would obscure the genuine consultation content that does exist. 

Systems that fall in this category have clear distinctions between consultations and other types of record content (for example, last `x` consultations displayed in patient summaries and to synthesise consultations would distort this native behaviour).
