In GP systems, in addition to ordering medications/medical devices and issuing them to a patient, it is also possible for clinicians to record medications/medical devices that were not issued by their GP practice. This may happen if a patient has been in hospital and informs a clinician that they were prescribed a medication or allocated a medical device during that episode of care.

All GP systems allow for data to be entered to record details of medications/medical devices that they are informed about, but do not issue within the medication/medical device section in the system.

The main uses are to record a medication or medical device being managed by another organisation, the requirement to enable interaction checking and decision support to interact with these items.
