The medication or medical device ordering process in GP systems can be considered to be a two-stage process:

1. **The authorisation** - this is where the medication or medical device is initially added on to the GP systems. It represents a ‘plan’ that the GP intends to authorise a medication for the patient.
    
2. **The issue** - this is the point the plan is turned into an actual ‘order’ or prescription. At this point the prescription will either be printed and signed, or the order will be passed on to the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) to send to the patient’s nominated pharmacy.
    

There are several clinical reasons why the process is split up in this way. Below are some examples of scenarios when it advantageous to have the separate parts:

- repeat medication added from a discharge summary ready for patient to request
- add blood pressure (BP) drug ready for follow-up nurse clinic to issue
- issue rescue steroid/antibiotic pack and add repeats for flares
- flu vaccinations

There are three different business processes for issuing a medication or medical device to a patient that are well established in general practice and are driven by factors such as how often a patient will require the medication/medical device, helping practices to create efficient processes for prescribing and applying the appropriate controls to drugs where appropriate. The three processes are:

1. Acute prescribing
2. Repeat prescribing
3. Repeat dispensing

### Acute prescriptions

An acute prescription is when a medication or medical device is a one-off prescription. It is usually a course of medication/ medical device that is issued to treat a specific complaint.

If the patient needs further medication/medical device they would need to see their doctor again for them to assess their condition and decide if another prescription is appropriate.

It is possible for clinicians where appropriate to postdate acute medications. For instance, in a situation where a patient has flu-like symptoms the clinician may provide a prescription for antibiotics dated a week in the future and advise the patient to use it if symptoms persist. This is also known as delayed prescribing.

### Repeat prescriptions

A repeat prescription enables a patient to be issued more than one prescription without it being necessary to see their doctor after each individual prescription.

The number of prescriptions is usually determined by the doctor when they make the initial order. However, it is also possible to set a review date for a medication or medical device that is prescribed in a regular manner instead of limiting the number of issues.

Typically, the duration that repeat prescriptions cover is 6 or 12 months although they are flexible and can be written for any period. Although the patient does not have to see their doctor to authorise each issue of the medication/medical device, they will need to have the prescription authorised by another clinician in the practice.

### Repeat dispensing

When a medication or medical device is repeat-dispensed the patient will be able to pick up the item from the pharmacy without the need for each prescription to be issued by the GP practice. Apart from the practice not needing to issue each prescription, repeat-dispensing works in a similar manner to repeat prescriptions where the doctor is able to determine the number of issues or the time period before needing to visit the doctor again for the prescription to be re-authorised.

### Unissued medications

It is possible in GP systems to record an intent to prescribe a medication or medical device but not to actually place an order for the medication/medical device. These will exist in GP systems without a prescription or EPS request ever being issued.
