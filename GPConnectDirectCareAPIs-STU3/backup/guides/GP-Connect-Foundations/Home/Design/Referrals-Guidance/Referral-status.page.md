GP clinical systems support recording the status for a referral or derive a status according to the actions which have been taken for the referral.
However, the statuses are not standardised across GP clinical systems. 
It is also understood that the GP practice may only be aware of a status change retrospectively and that the status of referrals are not routinely maintained in many GP practices.

Providers <strong>MUST</strong> set the <code>status</code> of the referral as <code>unknown</code> for all referrals.

<p>Consumers <strong>MUST NOT</strong> portray any referrals as indicating current involvement by recipients or any other interpretation of the status of the referral.</p>

<p>Where details of the progress or outcome of the referral are captured in the GP clinical system in a structured form they <strong>SHOULD</strong> be populated in the <code>note</code> element as appropriate key value pairs.</p>
