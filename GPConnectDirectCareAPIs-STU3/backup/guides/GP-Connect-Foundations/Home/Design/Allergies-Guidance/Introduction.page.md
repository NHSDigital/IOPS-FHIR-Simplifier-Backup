The recording of allergy and intolerance information in patient records is a major component of communicating the effects of external substances and compounds on patient health.

The allergy and intolerance concept is broad and multidimensional:

- the causation of allergy and intolerance may be linked to specific medications or pharmaceuticals or substances (biological or chemical) in the environment
- the weight and significance that may be attached to recorded allergy and intolerance is affected by a number of factors including the certainty of the allergy, the severity of the reaction and the likelihood of occurrence
- allergies and intolerances may be linked to other clinical events, such as diagnostic tests that confirm the presence of the allergy or linked to instances of illness caused by the allergy</li>
- allergies and intolerances may be dynamic and evolving, increasing in severity over time, recurrent or perhaps only active and observed within defined periods


The recording and handling of allergy and intolerance information has an important role to play in patient safety, not only with regard to clinical decision making, but also in the realm of prescribing decision support, where the presence of allergy information linked to causative agents can trigger automated alerts and restrictions when prescribing.

Given the complexity and depth of the allergy and intolerance domain there are significant differences and variations in the implementation of the allergy and intolerance concept across participating systems in terms of structure, terminology and the linkages between terminology and decision support. These differences limit the current interoperability of allergies and intolerances.

The GP Connect <code class="highlighter-rouge">AllergyIntolerance</code> FHIRÂ® resource aims to improve the interoperability of allergies and intolerances through convergence towards a standardised structure and common terminology.

The clinical importance of allergy and intolerance information coupled with the variability of implementations across participating systems means that there is a need for clear guidance on the utilisation of the GP Connect <code class="highlighter-rouge">AllergyIntolerance</code> resource by both providers and consumers.

These pages provide the required guidance:

- usage of the FHIR resource elements to represent allergy and intolerance concepts from participating systems
- guidance for providers on the correct representation of allergy/intolerance concepts as FHIR resources
- guidance for consumers on the handling of the FHIR resources in terms of expectations for what can be present in the resource and the handling of variations between systems
