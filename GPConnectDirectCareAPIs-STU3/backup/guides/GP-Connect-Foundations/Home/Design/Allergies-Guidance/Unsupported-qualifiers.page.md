## {{page-title}}

It is possible on some participating systems to attach system specific qualifiers to allergy or intolerance record entries, for example a priority for the allergy/intolerance record entry or an episodicity. Similarly, some systems support richer sets of values for severity than are catered for via the criticality and reaction/severity elements. The certainty qualifiers that exist in participating systems are not supported. In all cases, the full set of qualifiers and values that are associated with an allergy/intolerance in the source system <strong>MUST</strong> be rendered as text (suitable formatted name/value pairs) and placed in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AllergyIntolerance.note</code> element.
