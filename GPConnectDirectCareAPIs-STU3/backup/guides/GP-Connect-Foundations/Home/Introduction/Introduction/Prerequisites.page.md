### PDS
You need to be able to provide a verified NHS number to use an API. You can do this using a Spine accredited system, a Demographics Batch Service (DBS) batch-traced record (CSV), or using a Spine Mini Services Provider (HL7v3).

### SDS / ODS
To resolve a given GP Practice organisation to its URI you need to be able to do a Spine SDS query (LDAP) using the practiceâ€™s ODS code to perform an [SDS End Point Lookup](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-1-6-0/integration_spine_directory_service.html).

### FHIR
In order to be a compliant FHIR server, provider systems need to expose a valid FHIR [CapabilityStatement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/capabilitystatement.html) profile.

Refer to **Development Guidance - FHIR API Guidance - Common API Guidance [this link needs updating]** for full details on the common FHIR API patterns used throughout all the GP Connect APIs.
