The enablement team can help get you started by guiding you in the following:

#### 1. Confirming that the Prescriptions Management API fulfils your use case requirements
Read through this specification to ensure that it fulfils the requirements for your use case, and that the sending or receiving system(s) can meet the data requirements - for example, having the information required to populate the FHIR resources described in this specification. 

##### 2. Submit your use case for this API
Contact [gpconnect@nhs.net](mailto:gpconnect@nhs.net) about your use case.

##### 3. Getting your use case approved
Use cases are approved on the basis that development is started within six months. If this date is missed, then a review of the case will be required.

<div class="alert alert-warning nhsd-t-body" role="alert">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <b>Important:</b> Additional development will require a new use case submission.
</div>

##### 4. Getting conformance
Once approved, the service practitioner will:

- introduce the assurance process and artefacts to gain technical conformance
- set up a Microsoft Teams page which will be used to raise queries

<div class="alert alert-info nhsd-t-body" role="alert">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> Complex or unique use cases are taken to a weekly board for approval.
</div>

##### 5. Assurance
The developed solution will require assurance before it can be enabled in production.
