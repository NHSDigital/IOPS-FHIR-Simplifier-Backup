                    <li>The PODAC DigiMeds team was disbanded in 2023, and the Digital Medicines specification was deprecated in favour of GP Connect: Update Record.</li>
                    <li>With the exception of Vaccinations, all former use-cases that the Digital Medicines specification supported either have been, or will be migrated to Update Record.</li>
                    <li>NHS England have a national vaccination team who are at the time of writing, defining a strategic solution to flow vaccination events through the NHS ecosystem; however, in the interim, the Vaccinations part of Digital Medicines will be used to flow Seasonal Influenza, COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Pertussis vaccination events from Community Pharmacy, or NHS England's Data Processing Service (DPS).</li>
                    <li>Emergency supply of medicine events from Community Pharmacy will still flow using this mechanism using 1.1.3-alpha of the specification</li>
