Allergy information can be represented in two different ways:

* Using ['precoordinated'](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/precoordination) concepts i.e. expressing all the clinical ideas combined in a single code/field, such as `293584003 |Allergy to paracetamol (finding)|` in SNOMED CT.
* Using ['postcoordinated'](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/postcoordination) concepts i.e. using separate codes/fields for each clinical idea, and linking them together outside of the chosen terminology - such as `609328004 |Allergic disposition (finding)|` and `387517004 |Paracetamol (substance)|` in SNOMED CT. In this example, separate codes are used to represent the reaction type and the causative agent respectively.


This specification chooses to represent allergy information using postcoordinated concepts, as in the latter example.
