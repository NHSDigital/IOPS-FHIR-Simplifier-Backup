When using the MESH API the Send Message API call will be used by a practice API client to send a message to the MESH server. MESH metadata items are defined in HTTP header fields as described below:

More information can be found in the [MESH documentation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-api#post-/messageexchange/-mailbox_id-/outbox).


- `mex-from` **MUST** contain the MESH mailbox ID of the sender of the message â€“ for example, the originating organisation

- `mex-to` **MUST** contain the NHS Number, DOB and Surname of the patient delimited by the underscore character `_`. This enables automatic routing of the message to the registered GP MESH mailbox
