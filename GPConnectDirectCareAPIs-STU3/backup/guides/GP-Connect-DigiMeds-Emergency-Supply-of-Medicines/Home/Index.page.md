    <b>Important</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The retirement status of the emergency supply of medicines use-case has been removed.</li>
        <li>This version of the specification has been migrated from the NHS developer network. It <strong>does not</strong> change the guidance in the previous specification; however, it has been designed to make it clearer as to what data items are supported, and how they currently flow between community pharmacy and GP IT systems.
