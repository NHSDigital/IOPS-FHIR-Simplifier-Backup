## Data mapping analysis
The data mapping analysis derived from the Pharmacy Data model (primary cluster information) shows the data fields sectioned into structured and unstructured data types. This is implied based on the data item field types per cluster field types.  This will help to categorise the data mapping for presenting the data items to the GP connect data model.  Although all the data model items are structured, in this context the unstructured data types referred to in the diagram below refer to the potential to record summative information, hence this is not a transferable pick list of data items (1:1 relationship).  Therefore, these data items may record pharmacy user notes, where they will be presented to the GP connect model to be updated on to the GP record.
