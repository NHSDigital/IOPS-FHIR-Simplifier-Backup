To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, Direct care API has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use.

This engagement has included:

- general practitioners
- pharmacists
- practice managers
- GP practice administration staff

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the example pharmacy use case for the Update Record capability.  Additional use cases will be considered on a needs analsysis basis and the capability will be developed further as required.

New use cases have been submitted by consumer suppliers working with commissioning organisations and  health care ettings that want to use the update record functionality and these have been  discussed within the clinical input group for Direct Care APIs / GP Connect prior to assurance.
