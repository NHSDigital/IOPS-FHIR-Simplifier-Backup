The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for Update Record will provide the capability for a Use Case to send Encounter, Observations and Medications as structured data that will be automatically updated within the patient record without notifying the GP practice, or any form of acceptance or workflow functionality.
Future updates to the specification will look to add capabilities around:
* providing a mechanism whereby GP practices are made aware of some updates to the patient record so that those updates can be either accepted / rejected or actioned as appropriate.
* providing a mechanism to delete or amend the update of a patient record previously provided. This is dependant on being able to notify the GP practice of the change.  
* adding new data points such as immunisations or allergies
