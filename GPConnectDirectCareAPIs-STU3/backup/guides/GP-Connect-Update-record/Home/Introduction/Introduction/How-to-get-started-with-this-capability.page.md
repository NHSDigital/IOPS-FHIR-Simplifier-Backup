The enablement team can help get you started by guiding you in the following:

##### 1. Confirming Update Record fulfils the use case requirements
Read through this specification to ensure that it fulfils the requirements for your use case, and that the sending or receiving system(s) can meet the data requirements - for example, having the information required to populate the FHIR resources as described in this specification.

##### 2. Submit your use case for the Update Record capability
Contact [gpconnect@nhs.net](mailto:gpconnect@nhs.net) about your use case for the Update Record capability.

##### 3. Getting your use case approved
Use cases are approved on the basis that development for the use case is started within six months. If this date is not achieved, then a review of the use case will be required.
