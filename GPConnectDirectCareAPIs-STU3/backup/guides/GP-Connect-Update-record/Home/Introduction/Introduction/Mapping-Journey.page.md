Once implemented, this specification provides the ability for healthcare providers to flow specific data items, through an existing API over STU3, using SSP, related to healthcare service users to GP systems and update specific GP patient records without manual intervention.   The receiver service (GP Practice) will not receive notifications from updates received through this API specification.
