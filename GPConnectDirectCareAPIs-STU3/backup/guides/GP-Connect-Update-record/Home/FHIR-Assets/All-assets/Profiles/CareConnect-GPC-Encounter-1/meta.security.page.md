<h5><ins>Guidance</ins></h5>

The `meta.security` contains details on whether the patient consents for updating their record and sharing on patient facing services. `NOPAT` label can be used from the following code system `http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode`

-	Full details of an Encounter are sent without security label - Patient consents for Updating Patient Record and sharing on Patient Facing Services
-	Full details of an Encounter are sent with security label - Patient consents for Updating Patient Record but does not consent to share on Patient Facing Services
- Full details of an Encounter are not sent and sent with security label - Patient does not consent to Update Record and therefore also does not consent to share on Patient Facing Services (log encounter but donâ€™t add full details to patient record). For this instance only the mandatory fields in the encounter profile should be sent, all non-mandatory resources should be omitted from the payload.
