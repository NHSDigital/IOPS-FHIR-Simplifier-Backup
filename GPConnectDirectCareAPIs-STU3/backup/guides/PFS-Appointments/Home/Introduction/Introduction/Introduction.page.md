## {{page-title}}

This specification enables patients to book, view and delete their appointments through third-party applications. The FHIR Messaging components are based on FHIR STU3 and are detailed {{pagelink:Home/Build/FHIR-Resources.page.md}}.

FHIR Messaging components specified within this API have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within England’s health and social care systems.
