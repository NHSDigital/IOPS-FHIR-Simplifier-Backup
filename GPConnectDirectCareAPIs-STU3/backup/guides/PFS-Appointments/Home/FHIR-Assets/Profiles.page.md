Appointment Management incorporates the GP Connect data model. This contains guidelines on how providers need to populate each of the FHIR resources. We advise you to read the data model first to understand how the response is being populated by GP clinical systems. 

However, not all clinical information stored on GP systems may be safe to display for the end user (patients/citizens). This guide is intended to help consumers understand what is clinically safe and useful to display via GP Connect (Patient Facing) Appointment Management FHIR API from the GP Connect data model.

The relevant profiles in the data model are as follows:
