<h5><ins>Guidance</ins></h5>

The `identifier` element **MUST** be populated with a globally unique and persistent identifier (that is, it doesn’t change between requests and therefore stored with the source data). This **MUST** be scoped by a provider specific namespace for the identifier.

Where consuming systems are integrating data from this resource to their local system, they **MUST** also persist this identifier at the same time.

```xml
<identifier>
    <system value="https://foo.bar/id/immunization" />
    <value value="a58ca801-0858-47ce-8075-2df2c73935d1" />
</identifier>
```
