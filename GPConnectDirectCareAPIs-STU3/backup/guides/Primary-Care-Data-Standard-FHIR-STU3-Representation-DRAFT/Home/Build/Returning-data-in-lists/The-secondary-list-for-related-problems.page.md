The secondary list for problems is an exception to the rules above.

This list **MAY** be returned as part of any query and **MUST** contain problems that have been linked to any item in the primary list that is returned.

Only one related problem list **SHALL** be returned even if multiple clinical areas are queried. This means it is possible that this list will contain problems that are linked to multiple clinical areas. It is the responsibility of the consuming system to determine which items are linked to the problems in this list.
