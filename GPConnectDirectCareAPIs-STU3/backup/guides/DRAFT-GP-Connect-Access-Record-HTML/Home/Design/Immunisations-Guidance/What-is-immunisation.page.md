Immunisation is the process by which an individual’s immune system becomes fortified against an agent (known as the immunogen).

When this system is exposed to molecules that are foreign to the body, called non-self, it will orchestrate an immune response, and it will also develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of immunological memory. This is a function of the adaptive immune system. Therefore, by exposing a person to an immunogen in a controlled way, the person’s body can learn to protect itself: this is called active immunisation.
