As outlined in the ‘Styling the XHTML’ section of the FHIR® standard:
> In order to minimise manageability and security issues, authoring systems cannot specify the CSS stylesheet to use directly. Instead, the application that displays the resource provides the stylesheets. This means that the rendering system chooses what styles can be used, but the authoring system must use them in advance. Authoring systems can use these classes, which MUST be supported by all rendering systems.
