When querying for consultations and problems, [DocumentReference](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Profiles/Profile--CareConnect-GPC-DocumentReference-1?version=current) resources containing document metadata will be returned for any linked documents. The document location will be returned alongside the metadata so that consumers can retrieve the [Binary](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Profiles/Profile--Binary?version=current) resource for the document. In order to do this, consumers will need to have been assured against the [Access Document](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp-connect/develop-gp-connect-services/specifications-for-developers#gp-connect-api-specifications-listed-by-capability) capability.
