When describing investigation reports, different regions and professions sometimes use different words to describe the same entities. Therefore, for avoidance of confusion there are a couple of terms that we need to define.

- Test group - is the phrase we are using to describe any group of tests that has been created by the laboratory or other providing organisation. These are often referred to as batteries, panels and profiles.

- Test result - this is the result that has been provided by the laboratory or other provider. These may be standalone results or may be a part of a ‘Test group’. They are also sometimes referred to as test analytes.
