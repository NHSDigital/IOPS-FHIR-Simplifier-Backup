Patient consent
How are patient consent preferences dealt with?

- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> patient consent enforced by the provider system and cannot be overridden
- patient consent enforced by the provider but can be overridden by consumer

<span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> Patient consent enforced by the provider system **MUST** be adhered to when returning a patient record.

### Patient data exclusions
What patient data exclusions are associated with Access Record HTML?

These can be determined by two potential sets of exclusion settings:

- manual exclusion (based on explicit patient preference)
    - <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> provider system-based patient preferences
    - Summary Care Record (SCR) standard patient preferences (in addition)^1^
- automatic exclusion (based on implied patient preference)^2^

^1^ Providers are not initially expected to enforce SCR patient preferences in relation to returning API data. They **MUST** only respect their own principal patient preferences.

^2^ Automatic or inferred exclusions are not supported as this would be technically impractical (it’s not possible to filter out all free-text and other fields which could potentially contain data which should ideally be excluded).

<span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> Provider system **MUST** enforce exclusion rules, either for the complete patient record, or sections/data-items.

### ‘Confidential’ (GP practice-designated) data exclusions
How are ‘confidential’ data items dealt with?

- <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> provider system **MUST** enforce exclusion rules, either for the complete patient record, or sections/data-items
- <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> items designated by the practice as confidential **MUST NOT** be provided, and processed in the same way as patient data exclusions

### Sensitive data exclusion set
How are sensitive data items dealt with?

<span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> Provider API processing **MUST** support the application of an exclusion set, which **MUST** be configurable, including containing null values. The current Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sensitive exclusion set **MUST** be applied, for the complete patient record, or sections/data-items, but is likely to amended pending future guidance and review (to be approved by the Joint GP IT Committee (JGPIT)).

### Data sharing agreements

What data sharing agreements need to be in place?

- <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> data-sharing agreement **MUST** be in place between the consuming organisation and the providing organisation
- <span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> the Spine Security Proxy validates this requirement

Therefore, provider systems **MUST NOT** apply or change locally-configured data-sharing validation.

### Exclusion warnings
How are exclusion warnings identified within Access Record HTML?

- no indication that data has been excluded
- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> warning indication per section that data has been excluded (within the time frame)
- <span class="label label-success">SELECTED</span> in line with some information related to the data item
    - that is, encounter date/time but not the place or encounter details

<span class="label label-info">DECISION</span> Warning needed that data supplied for a patient may be incomplete/withheld due to patient preferences, GP practice designation of ‘Confidential’ or as a result of the application of the sensitive exclusion set - to be displayed both within the section banner as well as at line item level.
