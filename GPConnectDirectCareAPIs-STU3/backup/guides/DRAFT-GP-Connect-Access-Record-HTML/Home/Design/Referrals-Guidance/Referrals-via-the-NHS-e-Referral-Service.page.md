Referrals made via the NHS e-Referral Service (eRS) <strong>MUST</strong> be included by the provider where they are recorded in the GP clinical system.
The Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) <strong>MUST</strong> be included as an <code>identifier</code> if it is captured against the referral record.

Consumers should be aware that referral details may be limited for referrals via eRS or may be more likely to vary from the resulting referral.
Examples of limited details:

- <code>recipient</code> is not specified</li>
- <code>reasonCode</code> is non-specific - for example, ‘Referral for further care’


The examples above also represent general data quality issues and can apply to any referral not just those via eRS.
