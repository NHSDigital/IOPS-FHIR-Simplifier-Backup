- some systems do not restrict entry of clinical data to a consultation context - that is, it is possible to record clinical information about a patient without starting or initiating a consultation
- such "Non-Consultation" behaviour does not imply any loss of information or structure by the source system - that is, the record items are still fully recorded and attributed
- however, since they are recorded outside of a consultation context, they will not be returned by an API query directed at returning consultation resources (see the "Design decisions" section below)
