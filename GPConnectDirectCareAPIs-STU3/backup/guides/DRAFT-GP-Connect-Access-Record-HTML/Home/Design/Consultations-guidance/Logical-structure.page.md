Consultations follow a common logical structure:

**Context**

- Each consultation has context data that describes when and where the consultation took place, the patient it covered, and who else was involved (such as a doctor). This information is usually generated automatically by the provider system but it may include some manually recorded values.

**Topics**

- A Consultation will be split into one of more topics. Each topic describes an area of discussion (or activity) that took place in the Consultation.
- A topic may (or may not) have a title.
- A topic may (or may not) be related to a specific problem in the patientâ€™s record. In these cases, all the discussions and activities recorded under that topic are in regard to that problem.

**Headings**

- A topic may be split into one of more headings (sometimes referred to as SOAP headings). Each heading covers a specific part of the Consultation process about that topic.

- There is no national standard for headings so they will reflect the headings available in the provider clinical system.

**Clinical items**

- Within each heading there may be one or more clinical items. Grouped together and in order, these clinical items describe in full all the details recorded under that heading of the consultation.

- Any type of clinical item may form part of the consultation (medications, allergies, immunisations, uncategorised data, and so on).

**Topics without headings**

- A topic can be created without headings. In these cases, the clinical items are recorded directly under the topic the same way they are recording under a heading.
