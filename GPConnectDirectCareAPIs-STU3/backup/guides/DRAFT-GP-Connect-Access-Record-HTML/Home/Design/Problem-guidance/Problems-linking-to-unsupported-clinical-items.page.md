Depending on the GP Connect version supported by the provider system, it can be possible for the problem to link to a clinical item that the provider system is not yet able to export with GP Connect. For example, if the problem contains a link to a referral record but the provider system does not yet support exporting referrals.

Where a provider system is not able to export a linked clinical item, it will create a reference entry with the:

`Condition.extension:relatedClinicalContent.valueReference.display` should have the value: "[Clinical area] items are not supported by the provider system."

Where [Clinical area] identifies the type of the clinical item that is not supported.

The example below shows references to two items, one for an observation and another for referrals that arenâ€™t supported by the provider system:

<extension>
    <url value="http://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Extension-CareConnect-RelatedClinicalContent-1" />
    <valueReference>
        <display value="Referral items are not supported by the provider system" />
    </valueReference>
</extension>
