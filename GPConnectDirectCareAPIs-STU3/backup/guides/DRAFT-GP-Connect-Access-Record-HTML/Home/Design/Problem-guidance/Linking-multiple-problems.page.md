It is possible within GP clinical systems to link problems together. This is done by a clinician when they consider the problems to have a clinical impact or give context to each other.

The methods and terminology used to link problems varies a great deal between clinical systems and are not compatible with each other. For example, in one GP clinical system grouping two problems merges them into a single problem while in another it keeps them as two separate problems that are linked together.

To resolve this, GP Connect will only show the logical linkage between problems (whether the linked problem is a parent, child or sibling) without reflecting the terminology of the provider system.

Problem linkages may be impacted by filtering. 

The details on how this is implemented in an API can be found in the [API Definition - Retrieve a patient's structured record](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-1-6-0/accessrecord_structured_development_retrieve_patient_record.html).
