<p>The scope of diary entries is limited to incomplete actions only - that is, complete or cancelled diary entries <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be included.</p>

<p>GP clinical systems have differing approach to allocating status to incomplete diary entries.
It is unlikely that there is sufficient consistency of use of status, so all incomplete diary entries <strong>MUST</strong> be given a standard status of <code>active</code>.</p>

<p>The diary entry may not be updated automatically or immediately upon the action being taken to which it relates.
Consumers are to be aware that this may result in the inclusion of diary entries in a response which are incomplete in the GP system but have been actioned.</p>
