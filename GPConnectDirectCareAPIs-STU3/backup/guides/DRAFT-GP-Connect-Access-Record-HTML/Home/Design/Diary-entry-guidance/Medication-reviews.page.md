Medication reviews are considered to fall under the definition of a diary entry.
GP clinical systems which have a separate feature for medication reviews <strong>MUST</strong> include the medication reviews within diary entries.
The entered medication review code can be sent or the provider <strong>MAY</strong> substitute with the SNOMED CT code <code>314529007 | Medication review due (situation) |</code> as most appropriate.
Hereafter, reference to diary entries <strong>MUST</strong> be assumed to include medication reviews.

Consumers should be aware that medication reviews may occur in addition to the main, planned medication review(s) recorded in the GP clinical system and shared via this resource.
