Provider systems **SHALL** provide a mechanism for a data controller at a practice to choose to globally disable/enable the GP Connect provider APIs (that is, turn on/off the overall GP Connect technical capability at the practice), and this **SHALL** be deployed as disabled by default.

In addition, provider systems **SHALL** allow each assured GP Connect capability to be disabled/enabled independently of each other (Access Record HTML / Appointment Management / Access Record Structured / Access Document), and each capability **SHALL** be deployed as disabled by default.

Provider systems **SHALL** audit when GP Connect is globally enabled or disabled, or a GP Connect capability is enabled or disabled; in line with the {{pagelink:Home/Build/Cross-organisation-audit-and-provenance}}.
