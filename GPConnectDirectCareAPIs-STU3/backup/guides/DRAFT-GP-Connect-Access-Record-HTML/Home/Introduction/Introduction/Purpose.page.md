In an unstructured and pre-rendered format (HTML), this capability will provide health professionals with access to a patient’s primary care record by requesting sections or headings. Where appropriate, a date range can be defined to filter the retrieval of larger sections. These views can be incorporated directly into Electronic Patient Record systems.

The content displayed in the HTML views has then been used as a common baseline of available data to guide the structured and coded ‘Access Record’ approach.

Significant effort has already been made to unify the HTML section views from all four principal suppliers but it is expected that this will be an iterative process during development, UAT and FoT.
