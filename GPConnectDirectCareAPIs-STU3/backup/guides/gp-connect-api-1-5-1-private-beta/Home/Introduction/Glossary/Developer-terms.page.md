This guide uses a number of developer terms, details of which can be found in the [NHS Digital Glossary](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/glossary-of-developer-terms) of developer terms.

This guide also uses a number of terms more GP Connect centric. Where there is no defintion within the NHS Digital Glossary their definitions can be found below:

### Capability

The GP Connect FHIR® APIs are managed within ‘capabilities’ that focus on a particular business area of general practice and wider cross-organisational interoperability. Capabilities are organised within ‘capability packs’, which include:

- Appointment Management
- Access Record HTML
- Access Record Structured

### Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

A list of digital certificates that have been revoked by the issuing certificate authority before their scheduled expiration date and should no longer be trusted.

### Clinical Area

The structured patient record is split into a number of Clinical Areas each of which describes a different type of clinical data.

### Clinical Authority To Release (CATR)

Granted by NHS Digital Clinical Safety Group. It confirms that all clinical safety documents have been completed to the required standard.

### Clinical Item

A single item of data in the structured patient record.

### Clinical safety

The process of evaluating clinical safety risk. See [clinical risk management standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/solution-assurance/the-clinical-safety-team/clinical-risk-management-standards).

### Combined Message Handling Server and Accredited System (CMA) endpoint

An endpoint registered with Spine for a single system.

### Consumer application

A technically accredited software application that uses GP Connect FHIR® APIs.

### Consumer supplier

The developer of an application that uses GP Connect FHIR® API – for example, a system supplier in an acute or mental healthcare setting.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

A mechanism that allows restricted resources (such as fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

### Demographics Batch Service (DBS)

A mechanism that allows NHS and other organisations to submit a file of patient information to the Spine for tracing against the Personal Demographics Service (PDS). This requires a secure network connection. It is an offline service, and provides batch responses to batch trace requests, so smart cards are not required.

### Development Milestone Achievement Certificate (DevMAC)

Awarded to the provider of an API to certify it has met the specification requirements and is ready to deploy as a pilot (applies to GP principal clinical system suppliers).

### Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (EPMA)

The management of computerised prescription systems that enable clinicians to access, record and share information about patients’ medication.

### End User Organisation (EUO)

An organisation that uses a GP Connect service (or commissions the development of a new GP Connect service ) to access GP data from more than one clinical system provider to improve direct patient care. For example:

- a GP practice that is part of a federation, club or hub and is sharing data with other practices in the group
- a Commissioning Support Unit (CSU)
- an acute or mental health trust that is receiving GP data from a group of practices in its area
- an A&E or 111 service that is receiving data or booking appointments on behalf of a patient

### End User Organisation Policy (EUOP)

The legal and commercial agreement between NHS Digital and an end user organisation.

### Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

The complete domain name for a specific computer, or host, on the internet. The FQDN consists of two parts - the hostname and the domain name.

### GP Systems of Choice (GPSoC) contract

A contractual framework to supply IT systems and services to GP practices and associated organisations in England. Suppliers gain approval to offer services through a centrally controlled contract.

### GP principal clinical systems suppliers

The name given to a group of suppliers that provide GPs with the core system available under the GPSoC contract (also known as 'providers').

### Network Time Protocol (NTP)

A networking protocol for clock synchronisation between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.

### Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)

A conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

### Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)

A file format for storing and sending cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data.

### Provider supplier

The provider of a clinical system that is the source of GP data.

### Provider system

A GP clinical system that provides data through the GP Connect FHIR® APIs.

### Release candidate (RC)

In the context of a development of the GP Connect specification, denotes that the specification is close to completion and is being reviewed by external parties (including providers and consumers) and is subject to corrections and minor change.

### SOAP heading

An acronym for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan. A method employed by healthcare providers to write out and organise notes in a patient's consultation.

### Threat Protection System (TPS)

A category of security solutions that defend against sophisticated malware or hacking-based attacks targeting sensitive data.

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

A cryptographic protocol that provides communications security over a computer network.
