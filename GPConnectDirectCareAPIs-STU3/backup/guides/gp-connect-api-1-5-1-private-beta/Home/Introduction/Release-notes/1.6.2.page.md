#### Clarify overarching principles for MedicationRequest element population

**Affects:**  Access Record Structured

**Impacts:** Provider and consumer systems

**Description:**

There are two pre-existing [overarching principles](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Profiles/Profile--CareConnect-GPC-MedicationRequest-1?version=current#Overarching-principles) for populating MedicationRequest. The first is that all mandatory fields **MUST** be populated and has not changed. The second is how to populate fields that are duplicated in parent profiles, this has changed.

Previously, it was stated:

> "Required fields **MUST** always be populated where the data exists in the system apart from where a lexically identical value exists for an equivalent data item in one of the parent profiles. For a MedicationRequest with `intent` of `plan` the associated MedicationStatement would be the parent profile. For a MedicationRequest with `intent` of `order`, the associated MedicationStatement and MedicationRequest with `intent` of `plan` are both considered parent profiles."

This has been updated to state:

> "Required fields **MUST** be populated where the data exists in the system"

**Pages changed:**

- [MedicationRequest profile](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Profiles/Profile--CareConnect-GPC-MedicationRequest-1?version=current)

#### Update MedicationRequest.medication and MedicationStatement.medication datatype

**Affects:**  Access Record Structured

**Impacts:** Provider and consumer systems

**Description:**

- MedicationRequest and MedicationStatement profiles have had the constraint on the medication element relaxed so they align with the base profile i.e. medication can be either a reference or a CodeableConcept. This is to accommodate use cases such as updating the record where only a single medication is needed and a CodeableConcept would mean a separate Medication resource is not needed as there would be no other references to it. The guidance is for both consumers and suppliers to treat the element as if it is a reference.

**Pages changed:**

- [MedicationRequest profile](https://simplifier.net/guide/gpconnect-data-model/Home/FHIR-Assets/All-assets/Profiles/Profile--CareConnect-GPC-MedicationRequest-1?version=current)

#### Relax requirement for individual areas of the record to be turned on or off at a global level

**Affects:**  Access Record Structured

**Impacts:** Provider systems

**Description:**

- The requirement for individual areas of the record to be able to be turned on or off at a global level i.e. applicable to all sites, has been relaxed. Provider systems must continue to support toggling individual areas of the record at a site/practice level, along with responding to requests for areas that have been turned off continues to be the same.

#### New requirement for resolved allergies to be returned as transfer-degraded drug allergies ####

**Affects:**&nbsp; Access Record Structured

**Impacts:** Provider systems

**Description:**

- Resolved allergies are returned within a specific list for ended allergies. The allergy resources returned within the list should be returned as transfer-degraded drug allergies, SNOMED code `196461000000101`. This change mitigates against the scenario where the resolved attribution is lost during transfer as transfer-degraded resources are not able to be used by decision support.
