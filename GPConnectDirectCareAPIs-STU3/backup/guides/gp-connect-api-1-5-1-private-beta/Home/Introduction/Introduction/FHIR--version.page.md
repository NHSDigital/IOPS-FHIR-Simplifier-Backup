Standard for Trial Use 3 (STU3) is the version of FHIR which was adopted for the Access Record Structured capability. This was the current version at the time development was started by the GP systems suppliers.

The project is considering itâ€™s approach to uplifting to UKCore (the UK specific project for FHIR based on R4). It is currently exploring the mapping between versions and is involved in a proof of concept to see if it is possible to transform between the current GP Connect profiles detailed in this specification and the new UKCore profiles. If successful this may enable consumer suppliers to develop in either version.
