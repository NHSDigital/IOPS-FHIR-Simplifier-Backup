For this version of the specification the scope of investigations is considered to be making available any investigations results contained in GP systems that have been received from the lab by an EDIFACT message.

As such, there are a number of items that are **NOT** currently in scope. These are as follows:

- investigations results that have been entered in a GP system using a code as an individual item (these may have a value and other qualifiers associated with them)
- test results that are received as documents or images
- making available any test requests
- providing the original test report document as it was provided to the practice
- any other numeric results that do not form part of an EDIFACT message (blood pressure, height, weight)

These may be addressed in future versions or within different areas of GP Connect - for example, manually entered results will be dealt with when we curate the uncategorised data in GP systems contained in the journal or care history areas.
