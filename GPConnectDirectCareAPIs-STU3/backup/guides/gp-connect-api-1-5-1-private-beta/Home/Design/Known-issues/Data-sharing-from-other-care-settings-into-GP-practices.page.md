Only the data that is owned by the GP practice is able to be shared via GP Connect.

This means that if a GP practice is sharing in data that was entered in another care setting, such as a community practice, and displaying it to the users at the GP practice then it cannot share this data via GP Connect. As the GP practice is not the data controller for data entered in other care settings it does not have the right to share that data.
