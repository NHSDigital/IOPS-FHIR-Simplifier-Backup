The purpose of GP Connect is to make the data recorded in the patientâ€™s GP practice record available throughput the NHS to support the direct care of the patient. If there are any gaps, mistakes or other quality issues with the data in the GP practice record, these issues will show up in the data supplied by GP Connect. The quality of data will depend on the work done by local GP practices and will vary a great deal across the estate.

Further work to improve the quality of data recorded in the GP practice is outside the scope of GP Connect.
