A diary entry is primarily a proposal for clinical action to be undertaken at an indicative date in the future, which has not been completed or cancelled. 
The diary entry is dated but unscheduled - that is, it is not an appointment (but may result in an appointment being created) and resources are not directly committed to it. 
The diary entry may be a reminder for a review, a follow up to a consultation / treatment / test, a recall or treatment to be provided according to a schedule.
Diary entries may be known as ‘recalls’ within some GP clinical systems.

The use of diary entries may vary significantly from one practice to another and may not have any constraint in the scope as to what can be selected as the action associated to the diary entry.
Some examples of actions which may be recorded as diary entries are:


- Antipsychotic injections
- Asthma review
- Cytology Smear
- Depo Provera
- Diabetes review
- Epilepsy review
- Mental Health review
- NHS Health checks (5years)
- Over 75 Check
- Seasonal influenza vaccination due
- Repeat Blood tests


Any future intention for a clinical action recorded as an Appointment, Warning / Alert or Task is out of scope.
