<p>GP clinical systems <strong>MUST</strong> populate the <code>code</code> with a valid SNOMED CT code wherever practical.</p>

<p>GP clinical systems <strong>MAY</strong> include codes for incomplete diary entries which have a standard interpretation of a completed action (for example, procedure codes).
These <strong>MUST</strong> be interpreted as incomplete by consumer systems.
Consumer systems <strong>MUST</strong> ensure these are presented to system users in such a manner that it is clear and unambiguous that the coded item represents an incomplete planned action regardless of its text description or SNOMED CT meaning.<br />
The consumer system <strong>MUST</strong> maintain the diary entryâ€™s meaning as an incomplete planned action wherever the code element may be accessed or exported.</p>
