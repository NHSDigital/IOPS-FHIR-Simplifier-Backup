For GP Connect, a consultation is the structure within which source systems group one or more clinical record entries which occurred at the same time and for the same or similar purpose attributed to or asserted by the same actor.

- the provider system determines under what circumstances to create a consultation - this may vary between provider systems
- consultations do not exclusively represent clinician-patient encounters, although they are commonly used for that purpose
- consultations may record purely administrative or communications triggered events on source systems (for example, repeat medication administration, a pathology report filed into the patient record via messaging workflow)
- consultations are generally assigned and attributed to what can loosely be termed a Date / Doctor / Place / Type (Encounter), although these attributes may be overridden or refined in the context of individual record entries within the consultation
- consultations may or may not have associated structure (for example, the ability to decompose a - consultation into multiple topics / subjects / problems and within each "topic" further group clinical content under headings (SOAP headings) in line with long standing clinical note taking practice)
- consultations may also be recorded in non-structured form - that is, a grouping of clinical record entries under the same Date / Doctor / Place / Type but without additional structure (topics or SOAP headings)
- consultations may incorporate a range of different record entries (for example, measurements, test results, textual narrative, structured narrative, coded observations, medications)
