On some systems all or almost all record entry is captured in the context of a consultation. This, coupled with default behaviours such as starting a consultation on opening a patient record, leads to the phenomenon of ‘empty’ consultations where the Data / Doctor / Place / Type has been created as a default but there is no subsequent entry of any clinical information within the consultation.

Provider systems which allow empty consultations should not return empty consultations in response to consultation queries.

The same approach is followed for empty topic and heading levels recorded at source - that is, these should be suppressed by the producer.
