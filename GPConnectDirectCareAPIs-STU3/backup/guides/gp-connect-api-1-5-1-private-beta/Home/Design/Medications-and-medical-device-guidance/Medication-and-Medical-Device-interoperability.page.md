Consumers of medication/medical device resources generated by other systems <strong>MUST</strong> consider the clinical safety issues arising from processing medication/medical device information recorded in different care settings and contexts, and seek clinical safety guidance where appropriate.

Key concerns are the understandability of received medication/medical device information and appropriate actions to degrade and identify medication/medical device concepts which are not understood by the receiving system. Appropriate clinical workflows may also be required at the receiver - for example, deactivation of received medications/medical devices such that they <strong>MUST</strong> be explicitly re-authorised to make them issuable.

Currently dosage and quantity information are expressed in unstructured/textual form. A system intending to consume dosage and quantity information needs to be capable of handling unstructured quantities and dosages.
