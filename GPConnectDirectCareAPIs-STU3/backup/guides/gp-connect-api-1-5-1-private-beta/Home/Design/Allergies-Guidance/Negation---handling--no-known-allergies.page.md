Where there is an explicit assertion of the ‘No Known Allergies’ concept in the record, equivalent to SNOMED CT concept <code class="highlighter-rouge">716186003</code> and children, and there are otherwise no allergy or intolerance entries in the patient record, then systems may respond to queries for all allergy or intolerance resources using and <code class="highlighter-rouge">AllergyIntolerance</code> resource containing the appropriate code.

Where there are no allergy or intolerance entries in the patient record, but no explicit recording of the ‘No Known Allergies’ concept and equivalents, then systems <strong>MUST</strong> return an empty <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> with an emptyReason FHIR code: “No content recorded” and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">List.note</code> with the text:

> Information not available.

Because resolved allergies are queried via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">includeResolvedAllergies</code> query parameter and resolved allergies are conveyed via a separate <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code>, assertions of ‘No known allergies’ are true only in the context of a given list. Therefore, an empty ‘Active Allergies’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> only asserts that there are no active allergies and “No content recorded” in the context of the active allergies <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> asserts that there are no active allergies to contradict the recorded ‘No Known Allergies’ code. Similarly, where the <code class="highlighter-rouge">includeResolvedAllergies</code> flag is present an empty ‘Resolved Allergies’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> asserts the absence of resolved allergies and “No content recorded” asserts that the coding of ‘No Known Allergies’ is not contradicted by the presence of resolved allergies. Only the inclusion of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">includedResolvedAllergies</code> flag and emptiness of both lists can fully assert that there are no allergies (active or resolved) in the source record.

In most use cases consuming systems are only interested in active allergies, but the solution supports the retrieval of resolved allergies where this is required.
