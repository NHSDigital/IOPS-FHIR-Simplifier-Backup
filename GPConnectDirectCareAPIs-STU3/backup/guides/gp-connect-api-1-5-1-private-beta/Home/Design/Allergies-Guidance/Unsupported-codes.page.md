In some of the participating systems, an additional coded concept may be entered that represents the allergy or intolerance in addition to coding of the causative agent and reaction. These additional codes are not explicitly supported by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AllergyIntolerance</code> resource. The unsupported allergy code <strong>MUST</strong> be encoded as a textual qualifier in the note element.

*The reasoning being that as systems converge on interoperable coding of allergies and intolerances via AllergyIntolerance/code the need for another code to represent the allergy/intolerance concept diminishes.*
