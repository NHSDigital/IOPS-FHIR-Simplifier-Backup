On some participating systems it is possible to manage allergy/intolerance information via problem orientation. This means, for example, making an allergy/intolerance record entry a problem heading with associated episodicities, priorities, linkage (to other record entries) and even start and end dates for the problem, independent of the allergy/intolerance record entry.

*The dual representation of an allergy/intolerance as a problem <strong>MUST NOT</strong> affect the representation of the allergy/intolerance via the FHIR resource.*
