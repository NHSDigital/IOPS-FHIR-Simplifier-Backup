Allergy and intolerance information may co-exist alongside system support for the capture of medication adverse reactions via the MHRA Yellow Card scheme. Suppliers <strong>MUST</strong> ensure that only information directly associated with the allergy and intolerance entry in the system is included in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AllergyIntolerance</code> resource and not data only associated with the MHRA yellow card dataset.
