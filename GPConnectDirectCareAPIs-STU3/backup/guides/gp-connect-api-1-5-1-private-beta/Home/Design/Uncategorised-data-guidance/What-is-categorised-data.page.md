When a clinician / user of a GP clinical system records clinical data they may, as part of entering the information, identify what type of information they are recording.

For example, where the clinician uses a GP system’s allergy function to record a patient’s allergy information it is explicitly identified in the system as an allergy.

The volume of this categorisation varies between provider systems. For the majority of provider systems, the following types of information are explicitly categorised when they are recorded.

- Allergy
- Appointment
- Consultation
- Demographics
- Diary Entry
- Document
- Flag / Alert
- Immunisation
- Investigation
- Medication and Medical Device
- Problem
- Referral
- Test Request
