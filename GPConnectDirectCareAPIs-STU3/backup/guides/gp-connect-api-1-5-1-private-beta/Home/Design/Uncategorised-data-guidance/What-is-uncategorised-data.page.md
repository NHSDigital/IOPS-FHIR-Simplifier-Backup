There is data that a clinician / user will enter without identifying what type of information they are recording. This information is usually entered as a combination of clinical code(s), values, qualifiers and text.

For example:

- the clinician records the patient’s resting pulse by recording the resting pulse clinical code followed by a value of the patient’s pulse.
- the clinician records that a patient has a sore throat by recording the sore throat clinical code

Consideration was given to attempting to categorise data using the recorded clinical codes. It was decided not to progress this based on a clinical review of its risks and benefits.
