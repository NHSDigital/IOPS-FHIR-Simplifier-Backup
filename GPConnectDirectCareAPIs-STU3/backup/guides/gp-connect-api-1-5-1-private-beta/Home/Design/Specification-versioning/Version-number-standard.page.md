## {{page-title}}

The specification version number is based on the <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning 2.0.0</a> standard.

<p><img src="images/design/semantic-versioning.png" alt="Semantic versioning diagram" /></p>

When a specification is released, the version number is incremented as follows:

- **Major** version when breaking changes are made
- **Minor** version when larger non-breaking changes or unsubstantive breaking changes are made, for example a new capability; or a significant number of smaller non-breaking changes or unsubstantive breaking changes are made
- **Patch** version when smaller non-breaking changes or unsubstantive breaking changes are made
