**GP Connect API specification releases are assigned a single version number from 23 February 2018 onwards**.

The automated test suite, demonstrator and other artefacts released in line with the specification are also assigned the same single version number.

This supersedes the previous scheme whereby the constituent capability packs (Access Record HTML, Appointments etc) were released and versioned independently.
