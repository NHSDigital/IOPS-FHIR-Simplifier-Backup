When a consumer system requests data on a clinical area the information may be returned across a number of FHIR profiles.
Choosing which FHIR profiles to return is a balancing act between including enough linked profiles to give the consumer system a comprehensive response to their query but not including so many linked profiles as to swamp the consumer system with data.

The three main considerations used to decide which data to return for each clinical area were:

* include all the FHIR profiles required to fully describe the requested clinical area
* include the FHIR profiles required to define all the linkages from the requested clinical area
* include the FHIR profiles from linked clinical areas where they are key to understanding the requested clinical area

For each clinical area in a query that returns data a list should be generated that contains links to all data items returned for that clinical area.
Some query responses will contain more than one list for a clinical area.
The nature of the list can be determined from the list elements, see {{pagelink:Home/Build/Using-lists-to-return-data}} for details.

### Consultations and problems containing unsupported clinical items

Depending on the GP Connect version supported by the provider system it can be possible for the consultation or problem to link to a clinical item that the provider system is not yet able to export with GP Connect. For example, if the consultation contains a link to a referral record, but the provider system does not yet support exporting referrals.

Where a provider system is not able to export a linked clinical item, it will create a section.section.entry (or section.entry) entry with the:

* `List.entry.item.display` set to “[Clinical area] items are not supported by the provider system.”

       Where [Clinical area] identifies the type of the clinical item that is not supported.

The example below shows references to two items, one for an observation and another for referrals that aren't supported by the provider system:

```json
{
  "item": {
    "reference": "Observation/6734572634"
  }
},
{
  "item": {
    "display": "Referral items are not supported by the provider system"
  }
}
```

### Consultations ###

When GP Connect returns a consultation it will supply the metadata of the consultation and all the clinical data that was recorded during the consultation.

The response to the query includes:

* A `List` profile containing references to `Encounter` for every Consultation that met the search criteria
* A `List` profile for each clinical area that data exists in the bundle

For each `Encounter` referenced in the `List` profile:

* The `Encounter` profile of the Consultation
* The `List` profiles that describe the structure of the Consultation
* The `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any directly linked Problems
* The `MedicationRequest`, `MedicationStatement` and `Medication` profiles of any linked Medications or Medical Devices
  * Always include the `MedicationStatement`, `MedicationRequest` (intent = plan) and `Medication` profiles
  * Only include `MedicationRequest` (intent = order) for directly linked issues
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Medications and Medical Devices
* The `AllergyIntolerance` profile of any linked Allergies, including resolved allergies
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Allergies
* The `Immunization` profile of any linked Immunisations
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Immunisations
* The `Observation` profile of any linked Uncategorised Data
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Uncategorised Data
* The `ReferralRequest` profile of any linked Referrals
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Referrals
* The `DocumentReference` profile of any linked Documents
  * Only include the document metadata in any returned `DocumentReference` profile, do not include the binary file
  * In order to retrieve the binary file, a consumer must have been assured for the Access Document capability
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Documents
* The `DiagnosticReport`, `ProcedureRequest`, `Observation`, `Specimen` and `DocumentReference` profiles of any linked Investigations
  * Only include the document metadata in any returned `DocumentReference` profile, do not include the binary file.
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Investigation
* The `ProcedureRequest` profile of any linked Diary Entries
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Diary Entries
* All administrative profiles referenced directly (or via another administrative profile) by any of the clinical profiles included above
  * Include `Patient`, `Organization`, `PractitionerRole`, `Practitioner` and `Location`.

Where a Consultation links to a profile that is not yet supported by the provider system then it is not included in the response.
Details on how this is done can be found in the {{pagelink:Home/Design/Consultations-guidance}}.

Clinical items within the Consultation are always included in the response regardless of their inclusion/exclusion in other parts of the query.
So, for example, if a consumer requests consultations then any medications that are contained in the consultations returned will be present in the bundle, regardless of the medications parameter being absent or set to false in the request.

### Problems ###

When GP Connect returns a problem it will supply the metadata and description of the problem and all the clinical data that has been linked to the problem.

The response to the query includes:

* A `List` profile containing references to `ProblemHeader (Condition)` for every Problem that met the search criteria
* A `List` profile containing references to `ProblemHeader (Condition)` for every Problem not meeting the search criteria but directly linked to a Problem which does meet the search criteria
* A `List` profile for each clinical area that data exists in the bundle

For each `ProblemHeader (Condition)` referenced in the `List` profile:

* The `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of the Problem
* The `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profiles of any directly linked Problems
* The `Encounter` profiles of any linked Consultations
* The `MedicationRequest`, `MedicationStatement` and `Medication` profiles of any linked Medications or Medical Devices
  * Always include the `MedicationStatement`, `MedicationRequest` (intent = plan) and `Medication` profiles
  * Only include `MedicationRequest` (intent = order) for directly linked issues
* The `AllergyIntolerance` profile of any linked Allergies
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Allergies

  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Documents
* The `DiagnosticReport`, `ProcedureRequest`, `Observation`, `Specimen` and `DocumentReference` profiles of any linked Investigations
  * Only include the document metadata in any returned `DocumentReference` profile, do not include the binary file.
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Investigation
  * Where an `Observation` that represents a test or test group header has been made the actual problem then the 'diagnosticReport' it is from **MUST** be linked to the problem in the `relatedClinicalContent` extension.
* The `ProcedureRequest` profile of any linked Diary Entries
  * Include the `ProblemHeader (Condition)` profile of any Problems linked to the returned Diary Entries
* All administrative profiles referenced directly (or via another administrative profile) by any of the clinical profiles included above

Where a Problem links to a profile that is not yet supported by the provider system, then it is not included in the response. Details on how this is done can be found in the {{pagelink:Home/Design/Problem-guidance}}.

Clinical items linked to the Problem are always included in the response regardless of their inclusion/exclusion in other parts of the query.
So, for example, if a consumer requests a Problem that links to a Medication but does not explicitly request Medications in the query, the provider will still include the Medication linked to the Problem as part of its response.

### Problem and Consultation linkages ###

The sections above show general details of the linkages for problems or consultations responses.
This section looks at the representation of problem and consultation linkages, when consultations have been requested.
Providers **SHOULD** return all references between all resources wherever possible and include the actual clinical item which relates to the problem header whether the actual problem item or a subsequent recording of the problem.

The example below represents a simple case of a consultation and its content which all relates to a single, new problem.

* The problem header references to the consultation, the consultation topic, the actual problem and any other content of the consultation
* The consultation topic references the problem header
* The actual problem is included as a resource (an uncategorised data observation in this case) and references the consultation
* All other content of the consultation references the consultation and is referenced by the problem header

{{ render: Consultation_and_Problem.png }}

This further example represents a subsequent consultation which includes further information related to the problem above and other information related to a new problem recorded in the same consultation.
The consultation content relating to the existing and new problem is represented as described above, except the existing problem is shown with a new instance of a clinical item which is the same term.

{{ render: Consultation_and_Problem_2.png }}

### Multiple clinical areas requests ###

The details above have described the response a request for a single clinical area.
The consumer may include more than one clinical area in a request.
The request must be compliant with the criteria for multiple parameters as described in [API Definition - Retrieve a patient's structured record](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-1-6-0/accessrecord_structured_development_retrieve_patient_record.html)

<div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--bg-light-yellow nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6 nhsd-t-body">
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <b>To do:</b> Update link to API when available in API catalogue.
</div>

In responding to a valid multiple parameter request, the provider must return lists and resources as defined above for each clinical area included in the request.
In addition, the provider must return `List` resources as described in {{pagelink:Home/Build/Using-lists-to-return-data}}.
This may result in consolidated or multiple `List` profiles for clinical areas.
The following models demonstrate this.

This model is an example of a request for medications and allergies.
It is included to show how related problem references are consolidated into a single `List` profile where more than one clinical area has been requested.
This applies regardless of which clinical areas or how many clinical areas are included in the request.

{{ render: Medications_Allergies_Return.png }}

This model is an example of a request for consultations, problems, medications and allergies.
It also includes a consolidated related problems `List` profile, but is included to show the multiple `List` profiles returned due to the inclusion of

* a primary list for each of the requested clinical areas
* secondary lists for all clinical areas contained in consultations or linked to problems, regardless of inclusion in the request

{{ render: Summary_Return_v5.png }}

### Duplicate returned profiles ###

Where the same instance of a profile is returned from multiple query responses (for example a medication is returned as part of the medication search and the consultation search), it will only be included once in the response message.

The details on how this is implemented in an API can be found in the [API Definition - Retrieve a patient's structured record](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-1-6-0/accessrecord_structured_development_retrieve_patient_record.html).
