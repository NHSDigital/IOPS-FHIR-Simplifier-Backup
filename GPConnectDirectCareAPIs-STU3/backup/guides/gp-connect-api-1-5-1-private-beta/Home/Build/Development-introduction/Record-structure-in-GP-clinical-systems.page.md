There are several GP clinical systems in use in England and, although there are many differences in functionality, there are many categorisations that are common across most/all of the different systems. In GP Connect we have called these categorisations 'clinical areas' and have treated each one as a separate group of data that can be retrieved by the API.

For each of these clinical areas in GP systems, there is usually a separate screen or module for entering and viewing data. However, it is normal that there are a number of different ways for a user to view data that has been entered. It is common, for instance, to view an allergy in a separate allergy screen, in a view of a consultation, in a date-ordered screen containing all clinical items often called a journal or care history screen or in a screen that is a one-page summary of the patient record.

Defining all the clinical data areas within a patient record has enabled GP Connect Access Record Structured to more clearly define the scope of the project. It will also help providers and consumers to understand how we intend to make available the whole record and how far we are through that journey in any given release.
