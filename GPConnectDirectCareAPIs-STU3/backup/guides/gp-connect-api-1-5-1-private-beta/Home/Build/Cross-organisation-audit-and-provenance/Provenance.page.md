Provider systems **SHALL** ensure that all additions, amendments or logical deletions to administrative and clinical data made via an API is clearly identified with information regarding the provenance of the data (such as timestamp, details of consumer system, details of user (including role)), so it is clear which information has been generated through an API rather than through the provider system itself.

Provider systems **SHALL** record the following provenance details of all API personal and sensitive personal data recorded within the system:

- author details (identified through unique ID), including name and role
- data entered by (if different from author)
- date and time (to the second) entered
- originating organisation
- API interaction
