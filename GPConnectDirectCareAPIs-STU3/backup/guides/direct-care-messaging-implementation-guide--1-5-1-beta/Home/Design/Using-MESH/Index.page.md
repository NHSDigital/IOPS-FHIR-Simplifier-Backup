Viewed very simply, MESH is like a poste restante service for electronic message delivery. Messages flow around the NHS using MESH as follows:

- sender creates message and sends to the MESH server
- MESH server places the message in the destination mailbox
- receiver collects the message from their inbox
- message senders and receivers have two options when connecting to the central MESH server: MESH API or the MESH client
