<span class="nhsd-a-tag nhsd-a-tag--bg-light-blue">Released on 26th August 2022</span>

[Link to specification](https://simplifier.net/guide/gp-connect-send-document/Home/Introduction/Introduction?version=2.0.0-public-beta)

This is a major release version of the GP Connect Send Document capability and includes changes to the way documents are identified, and cardinality of the Practitioner FHIR resource.

The change will allow **any** attachment (e.g., PDF / TIFF) to be sent using this capabiltiy, subject to approval by the NHS, and harnesses the potential of SNOMED to:

- identify the type of document being sent
- the care setting in which the activity took place (if known)
- an optional SNOMED code to provide further context about the event

#### Receivers (consumers)
Receiving systems need to be updated to accordingly to:

1. Identify payloads using `Composition.type` rather than MESH workflow ID and the `LocalExtension` in `Extension-ITK-MessageHandling-2`
2. Take note of the SNOMED codes within care setting and event information within the required `Composition.extension:careSettingType` and optional `Composition.event` and present alongside the attached PDF in the patient record
3. Update their implementation to start receiving on the new MESH workflow ID - while also supporting the legacy workflow ID in the short-term to allow providers (senders) to update their implementation
4. The RecipientType element (i.e. 'For Action' and 'For Information') to be checked to ensure that is is visible for GP Practice users to allow identification of cases that they may wish to prioritise. Ideally it would also be possible to sort or filter by the 'For Action' or 'For Information' flag.


#### Senders (providers)
Once the receiving systems are capable of supporting this version of GP Connect Send Document, sending systems will need to be updated accordingly to:

1. Use the new MESH workflow ID
2. Ensure the correct SNOMED code is being used within `Composition.type`
3. Provide additional information if known / necessary within `Composition.extension:careSettingType` and `Composition.event`
