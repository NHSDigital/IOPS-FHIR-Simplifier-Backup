It is expected that the `generalPractioner` element will **NOT** be included when sending a document using this capability, as MESH will handle the recipient using a mailbox lookup.

<div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--bg-light-yellow nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6 nhsd-t-body">
    <b>Note</b>: If a document were sent without using MESH, then this information could be particularly pertinent (using the Organization or Practitioner FHIR profiles); however, this is not currently covered within this guidance.
