<h5><ins>Guidance</ins></h5>

The `identifier` element **MUST** be populated with a globally unique and persistent identifier (that is, it doesnâ€™t change between requests and therefore stored with the source data). This **MUST** be scoped by a provider specific namespace for the identifier.

Where consuming systems are integrating data from this resource to their local system, they **MUST** also persist this identifier at the same time.

```xml
<identifier>
    <system value="https://foo.bar/id/specimen" />
    <value value="fef26348-ccd1-440b-940e-ba1ec058cf21" />
</identifier>
```
