### Storage
When storing the item, the receiving system may choose to store any or all of the clinical
codes associated with the item.

However, where the system supports SNOMED CT codes it MUST store any SNOMED CT
codes associated with the item.

Where the receiving system does not understand any of the supplied coding.systems for
which a coding has been associated with the item (or no clinical codes were supplied), it may
choose to record the item under a degraded code. The appropriate SNOMED degrade code
should be used within the system to store the code.

The following codes are available in SNOMED to represent degraded items and can be used
when populating FHIR resources.

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Degraded Drug Allergies </td>
            <td>196461000000101 - Transfer-degraded drug allergy</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Degraded Referral </td>

        </tr>

            <td>196441000000102 - Transfer-degraded request</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Other degrade</td>
            <td>196411000000103 - Transfer-degraded record entry</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

Where an item that is being degraded is contained within a resource that infers a particular
type of degrade then the appropriate code shall be used e.g. a code in a FHIR medication
resource shall use the ‘Degraded medication’ code.

Clinical systems MUST NOT attempt to infer a particular type of degrade code where there is
no clear indication that a specific type of data has been degraded. In these scenarios the
‘Transfer degraded record entry’ code shall be used.


### Display
When displaying the item to end users, it is the choice of the receiving system to design their
system and user experience in a safe manner that best suits their users.

### Propagation
When propagating coded data to another system, the system which received the item may
choose which clinical codes to include when sending the item.

If a receiving system receives a SNOMED code that it does not understand it COULD store
this code and propagate it onwards if the data is exported. If systems decide to do this they
should consider what would happen if the data item is changed/edited.

<b>Note:</b> Whilst it is the receiving system’s decision which clinical codes are appropriate for it to store, NHS England requires that SNOMED CT is supported across the entire NHS estate by April 2020.
