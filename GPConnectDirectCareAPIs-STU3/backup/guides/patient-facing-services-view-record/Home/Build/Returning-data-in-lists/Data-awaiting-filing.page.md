When a GP Clinical system receives electronic data about a patient it will go through filing process during which the information is reviewed by a user and if suitable integrated into the patient’s medical record. The details on how this process is managed vary between different GP Clinical Systems and GP Practices.

GP Connect will not return electronic data that has been received by the GP Clinical System but has not yet been through the filing process. The data will only become available through GP Connect once it has integrated into the patient’s medical record.
