Confirmation of compliance with the clinical safety standards as above will be specified as part of the GP Connect Target Operating Model (TOM) against which the consumer supplier will need to assure. The TOM is managed and administered by the NHS Digital Solutions Assurance team.

Commissioning clinical safety approval of the consumer system forms part of the NHS Digital requirements for deployment into live operation.

Provider systems must also demonstrate standards compliance as part of the NHS Digital assurance processes.
