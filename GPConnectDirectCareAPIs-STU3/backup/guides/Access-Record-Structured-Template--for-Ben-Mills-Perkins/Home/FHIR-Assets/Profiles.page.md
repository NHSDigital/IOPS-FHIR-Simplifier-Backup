- The implementation guidance is for most standard use cases of presenting elements in Consumer applications (envisaged to be implemented for mobile interface). It does not prohibit other specific use cases, but that appropriate assessment is encouraged.

- Support from the programme team will be available to Consumers with alternative use cases to assist them with understanding the available data and applicability to alternative presentation. This is to provide appropriate information from which Consumers can make their own hazard evaluations and develop their own clinical safety case.

- The implementation guidance is currently in a draft stage. It will continually be refined over time through user research and understanding of further use cases.

- The implementation guidance is not intended to replace or serve as a substitute for any audit or professional orders. It is advised to consult NHS Digital for advice concerning any use cases or other matters before making any decisions.
