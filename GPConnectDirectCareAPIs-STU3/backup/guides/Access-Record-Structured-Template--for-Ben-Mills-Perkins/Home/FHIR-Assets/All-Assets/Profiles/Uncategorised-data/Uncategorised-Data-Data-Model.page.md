<b>Note</b> - Uncategorised Data is not a clinical heading in its own right, it represents the remainder of the clinical record which is not covered by the other clinical headings. It should not be used as a clinical heading in itself. It covers several clinical headings such as procedures, family history, measurements and many more. They are not fully standardised as clinical headings in the source system.

The Consumer can create its own headings from within the Uncategorised data; a subset of Uncategorised data with other clinical headings or create a 'journal' / chronology by combining uncategorised and other clinical headings (in full or part).

Patient Facing Services incorporates the GP Connect data model, this contains guidelines on how Providers need to populate each of the FHIR resources. It is advised to read the data model first, to understand how the is being populated by GP clinical systems. 

However, not all clinical information stored on GP systems may be safe to display for the end user (patients / citizens). This guide is intended to help Consumers understand what is clinically safe and useful to display via PFS from the GP Connect data model.

The relevant profiles in the data model are as follows:
