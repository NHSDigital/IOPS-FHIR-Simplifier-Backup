### Document reference

<h5><ins>status</ins></h5>

<span class="fas fa-times-circle text-danger fa-lg"></span> Not advised for PFS

<h5><ins>Further information</ins></h5>

<p>The element has values consisting of 'current', 'superseded' and 'entered-in-error'. Our approach with 'entered-in-error' is not to be shown via PFS. With 'superseded' this is yet a value to be used. Displaying just the ‘current’ value will have no significance  or can be misinterpreted by the patient / citizen.</p>
