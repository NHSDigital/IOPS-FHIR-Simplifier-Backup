<b>Summary</b>: Details of what activities form the basis of testing for API provider systems
</div>

Provider systems SHALL undertake the following testing process:

- Technical conformance for functional testing of provider APIs

- Solution assurance for functional, non-functional, ready-for-operation and clinical safety

</br>

### Technical accreditation

Provider systems SHALL be (or have previously been) tested and accredited to establish baseline Spine connectivity prerequisites:

- N3 connectivity / ASID / PKI Certificate

- Personal Demographic Service (PDS) integration ({{pagelink:Home/Authentication/Integrate-with-Spine/Personal-Demographic-Service.page.md}})

- Spine Directory Service (SDS) integration ({{pagelink:Home/Authentication/Spine-Directory-Services/Overview-and-querying.page.md}})

</br>

### Technical conformance

Provider systems SHALL be tested for technical conformance of the following before they can be listed on the product catalogue:

- Foundations

- PFS Access Record Structured

- Access Document

</div>

</br>

### Solution assurance

Solution assurance ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation providing the APIs.

<b>Important</b>: Suppliers are responsible for their own testing and the clinical safety of the delivered system. Supplier-authored tests must be traceable back to the published specification. NHS Digital’s automated test suite is non-exhaustive and does not cover all test cases/scenarios required to pass solution assurance. NHS Digital expects to see evidence of more supplier authored tests in addition to the NHS Digital authored tests.

#### Witness testing
Provider systems SHALL undergo witness testing to validate conformance to requirements which can’t easily be automated.
