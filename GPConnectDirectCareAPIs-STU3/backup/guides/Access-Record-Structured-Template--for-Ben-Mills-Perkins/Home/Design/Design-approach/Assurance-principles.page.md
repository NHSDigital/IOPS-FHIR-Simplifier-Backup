<b>Summary</b>: High-level design principles related to the assurance processes
</div>

- assurance should be lightweight but appropriate

- testing should be automated where possible to establish technical conformance

- a level of self-certified solution assurance will be made available to organisations deploying the APIs

- all artefacts related to assurance and testing should be made available as part of the ecosystem (public domain) prior to engaging in a formal NHS Digital assurance process

- a set of evidence based around self-assurance activities will speed up the assurance process
