### Overview​

All GP clinical systems (Providers) must have a method of preventing data being visible to patients / citizens with online record access. This is generally known as data redactions.

<b>Note</b>: Redactions may also be known as restrictions or hide from patient / citizen view)

Inside clinical sections (e.g., allergies / adverse reactions and medications) are elements (elements can be coded or free text). Redactions is the ability to allow GPs or permitted health care professionals (HCP) to redact existing or new clinical records from GP clinical systems. So that elements recorded as redacted are not displayed to patients / citizens via PFS. 

Before record access is switched on all the data that the patient will see should be checked for sensitive data that needs to be redacted. 

Examples MAY include, but are not limited to:​

- Groups of elements e.g. an entire consultation​

- Individual elements e.g. a code, a medication
