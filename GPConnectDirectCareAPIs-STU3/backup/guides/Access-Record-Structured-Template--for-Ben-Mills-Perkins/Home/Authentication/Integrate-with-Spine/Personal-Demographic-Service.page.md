## PDS tracing

GP Connect systems <b>SHALL</b> be capable of performing Personal Demographic Service (PDS) tracing of patients to obtain their NHS number, date of birth and current registered GP organisation.

[Spine Core FHIR API Framework - Personal Demographics Service](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core-1-0/pds_overview.html) provides a summary of the role of PDS in the NHS Spine architecture, and describes three options for accessing it. Systems <b>SHALL</b> perform this tracing using one of the three options.

<b>Important</b>: The term “consuming system” on the PDS page of the Spine Core FHIR API Framework site applies in the GP Connect context to both consumer and provider systems.
