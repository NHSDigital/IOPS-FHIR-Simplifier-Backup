### Aim of Consumer Guidance

To help software houses build safe interfaces and handle any documentations or patient information. To provide material of 'what it may look like' for testers/clinicians to test or review.

### Potential Consumers

Consumers could be a 111 service, an independent mental health service, hospital, even a group of GP practices.

### Using HTML alongside structured documents
==[TO DO]== Might be worth covering that HTML doesnâ€™t cover documents and a lot of people have been asking can I use access document alongside html - we might be able to show this in the guidance and say yes for those who are existing HTML users. We would review this with clinical team to get a steer.

### Other areas to explore 
==[TO DO]== Other thing to do is to review the other resources and see if there is anything linked to documents. E.g. what information shall I present in the UI. Don't always need to answer the question but can just signpost to where to get the information.
- There might be something about search functions.
- There might be something about confidential items too.
- Do we go through the hazard log, what will that show? May be good source. You can link back too e.g. links to hazard 28.==
