## Introduction

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i><b> Important:</b> This page is under development by NHS Digital</div>

The PRSB has worked with professionals, people with diabetes and suppliers to produce two information standards (https://theprsb.org/diabetes/):

- A diabetes information record standard, for a person-centred record about a person with diabetes for use across healthcare settings. 
- A self-management data standard, for sharing information that a person with diabetes collects and records at home and wants to share with their health and care team.

NHS Digital, supported by the PRSB will develop technical messaging standards aligned to the above information standards. This will include:

- Mapping the information standards to the existing national messaging standards (FHIR UK Core) and, where they do not map, working with the ICS community to develop solutions for early use to drive consistency. 
- Mapping the information standards to GP Connect to demonstrate how information could be pulled from, and pushed into, GP systems.  


### Example use cases

Example use cases at this stage are: 

1. Self-management data collected from a CGM / insulin pump into an electronic health record. 

2. Sharing diabetes information about a person between a GP, hospital and eye screening service
