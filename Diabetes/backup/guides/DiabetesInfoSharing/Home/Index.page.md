## Diabetes Technical Standards Implementation Guide

This specification provides guidance on how diabetes information is exchanged between different health settings - patient/carer, primary care, community and acute.  This guide will initially describe how PRSB information standards (https://theprsb.org/diabetes/) are being translated into the [FHIR UK Core](https://simplifier.net/guide/hl7fhirukcorer4release1?version=current) standard.
