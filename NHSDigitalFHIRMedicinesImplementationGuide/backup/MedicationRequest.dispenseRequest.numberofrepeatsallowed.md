### MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.numberOfRepeatsAllowed

This element was introduced in HL7 FHIR R4 and duplicates the element `numberOfRepeatPrescriptionsAllowed` in

| FHIR Version | Extension |
|--
| UKCore R4 | `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-MedicationRepeatInformation` |
| CareConnect (GP Connect) STU3 |`https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Extension-CareConnect-GPC-MedicationRepeatInformation-1` |
| CareConnect STU3 | `https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-CareConnect-MedicationRepeatInformation-1` |

It is recommended the core element is used in FHIR R4 and future versions and the element in the UKCore extension is retired in future versions.
