### Returning Prescriptions to EPS

A prescription may be downloaded, but never dispensed by the pharmacy, for example if the pharmacy cannot supply the prescribed medication items. 

To allow the patient to visit a different dispenser the prescription must be returned to the Spine using the `PUT /Task` interaction. Once returned, the prescription should be removed from the local System.

See {{pagelink:ReturningPrescriptionstoEPS}} for examples and explanation of the payload.
