## How to use this implementation guide

This section provides a generated <a href="#P1">site map</a> of this implementation guide. 


## Intended Audience

This section describes the type of audience that the section or page is targeted at (if any) where none is stated then the page should be seen as a general page for every reader.

|Audience|Description|
|--
|Clinical|Someone who is reviewing the implementation guide from a clinical perspective, including clinical safety, clinical pathway and informatics; as a clinical professional involved in initial implementations or further roll-out approaches|
|Business|Someone who is reviewing the implementation guide from a business process perspective; as a business analyst looking into workflow and the impact on existing business processes|
|Architect|Someone who is reviewing the implementation guide from an architectural perspective; as a solution architect looking into how this implementation will fit in with existing systems and interfaces |
|FHIR |Someone who is reviewing the implementation guide from a standards perspective; as a person with FHIR knowledge involved in reviewing the implementation guide for compliancy with the FHIR standard or alignment with other FHIR implementations|
|Developer|Someone who is reviewing the implementation guide from a development perspective, the developer who will be coding or involved in the building of the API or system|
|Other|Someone looking into the contents of the implementation guide for any other reason, for example as part of their education or a research project. This type of audience is implied and not shown in the table below.|

## Implementation Guide Format and Structure

The table below gives the reader of this implementation guide guidance about the structure of the guide and an indication of the purpose and intended audience of the sections and pages the guide contains. The intended audience is included to illustrate which type of reader the page is primarily aimed at and of course does not exclude other types of readers from reviewing and feeding back to the team producing the implementation guide.   

Note: not all pages described in the table will be present in every implementation guide as the content is dependent on things such as:

- How the information is exchanged (which FHIR Paradigm used RESTful, Messaging, Document etc.)
- Whether Clinical headings are used in the exchange of the information
- Which FHIR assets are used in the information exchange
- The type of information that is being exchanged
