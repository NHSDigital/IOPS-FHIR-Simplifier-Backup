The Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) supports the **prescribing of medication for dispensing in the community** via the following prescribing use cases:

- Primary Care, Community Care and Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) medication requests to community pharmacy (aka an `FP10` in the legacy paper process). 
- Outpatient medication requests to be dispensed by a Community Pharmacy (aka an `FP10HNC` in the legacy paper process).
- Outpatient medication requests to a contracted Outpatient pharmacy.
- Outpatient medication requests to a Homecare medicines provider.
