### Claims

The Claims and Claims amend process is a follow on to the Dispensing API. The Claims process can only start when a prescription is fully dispensed and no outstanding items are awaiting to be dispensed. The endorsement codes are captured within the Dispensing system and are attached to the message within Claims, this follows on to capture the charge status of the patient and finally is submitted to NHSBSA via EPS for validation and verification.
