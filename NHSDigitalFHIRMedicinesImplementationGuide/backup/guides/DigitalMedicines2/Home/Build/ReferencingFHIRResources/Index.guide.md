### Referencing FHIR Resources

The method by which other FHIR resources, e.g. Medication or Patient, can be referenced is done in several ways:

There are three options;

1. Identifier or CodeableConcept Reference
2. Resource Reference to a resource within the FHIR Bundle or a remote server
3. Resource Reference to a “contained” resource within the resource
