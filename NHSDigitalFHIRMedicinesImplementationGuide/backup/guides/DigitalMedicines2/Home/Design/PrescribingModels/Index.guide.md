## Prescribing Models

### Prescribing Models

The EPS supports three prescribing models in addition to existing paper based FP10 prescribing. The prescribing models, depicted in the figure below, are:

- acute (Acute Prescribing)
- continuous (Repeat Prescribing)
- continuous-repeat-dispensing (Repeatable Prescriptions)

The prescriber must still be available to provide a paper FP10 prescription to the patient, if requested by the patient or if desired by the prescriber. Electronic prescriptions will be the default and FP10 prescriptions only produced in exemptional circumstances.
