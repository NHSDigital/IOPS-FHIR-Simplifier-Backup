## PDS Dispensing Contractors and Nomination

As per current processes, a patient may require prescribed items to be authorised across different prescriptions to allow for dispensing by different dispensing contractors.

Four dispensing site preference codes are defined within EPS {{pagelink:DM-Performer-Site-Type}}

### Patient Dispensing Nomination

A patient can choose up to three nominated dispensers to cover different contractor types:

- Community Pharmacy
- Appliance Contractor
- Dispensing Doctor

Nomination information is stored in the PDS and is updated using the same update semantics as other aspects of the patientâ€™s demographic record. 

The following is an example of a patients Community Pharmacy, Appliance Contractor and Dispensing Doctor nominations retrieved from the PDS FHIR API.

```json
...
"extension": [
    {
      "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-NominatedPharmacy",
      "valueReference": {
        "identifier": {
          "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code",
          "value": "Y12345"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-PreferredDispenserOrganization",
      "valueReference": {
        "identifier": {
          "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code",
          "value": "Y23456"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-MedicalApplianceSupplier",
      "valueReference": {
        "identifier": {
          "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code",
          "value": "Y34567"
        }
      }
    }
    ]
    ...
```

Where a nominated dispenser is not available, or the patient does not wish to use their nominated dispenser then this information must be omitted.

The codes used are ANANA/ODS codes and the details of these can be retrieved using a SDS LDAP lookup or by using the FHIR STU3 ODS API https://nhsconnect.github.io/FHIR-ODS-API/ 
For example: to retrieve details of the patients nominated pharmacy (Y12345), the ODS FHIR API Query would be 

```
GET https://directory.spineservices.nhs.uk/STU3/Organization/Y12345 
```

The nominatedPharmacy in {{pagelink:NHSDigital-MedicationRequest.md}} does not have to match the nominations above. If the nominations in PDS are incorrect it is recommended these are updated during the prescribing process.
