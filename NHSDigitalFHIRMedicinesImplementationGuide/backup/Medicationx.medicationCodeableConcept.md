#### Medication[x].medicationCodeableConcept	

The use of this element is preferred over a reference to a `Medication` resource (element `medicationReference`). This is to simplfy the technical implementation around drug codes and to be backwardly compatible with HL7v2 and HL7v3 (EPS).

An example of the preferred approach is shown in {{pagelink:IdentifierandCodeableConceptReference.md}}

The CareConnect approach of using a `medicationReference` is shown in {{pagelink:ResourceReferencetoaresource.md}}
