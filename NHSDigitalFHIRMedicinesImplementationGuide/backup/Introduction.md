- Primary Care, Community Care and Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) medication requests to community pharmacy (aka an `FP10` in the legacy paper process). 
- Outpatient medication requests to be dispensed by a Community Pharmacy (aka an `FP10HNC` in the legacy paper process).
- Outpatient medication requests to a contracted Outpatient pharmacy.
