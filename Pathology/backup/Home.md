This specification is currently defined as in "Discovery" and as such is provided for consultation and discussion. This project is being developed using an agile approach so iterative updates to content will be added on a regular basis. It is anticipated that the message specification and implementation guidance will be updated further following First of Type (FoT) implementation.

### <b>Scope</b>

The National Pathology Message Specification defines a set of draft HL7 FHIR R4 profiles to support the exchange of pathology laboratory test results. The initial focus is on using the message specification as a replacement for the existing PMIP EDIFACT messaging standard for Primary Care requested test results.

The following are currently outside the scope of this work:
- The sharing of pathology results in relation to national screening programmes
- Laboratory to laboratory communications
