## Profiles
The profiles that are referenced by this specification are listed below. Each profile is documented using the format described in {{pagelink:ProfileDescriptions}}.

**Note:** The profiles are derived from the [UK Core Implementation Guide STU2 Release for Ballot]( https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu2/Home?version=1.1.3) which is currently under review. The profiles are therefore subject to change. The STU2 version of the UK Core Implementation Guide introduced a new set of laboratory specific FHIR R4 derived profiles, indicated by the ‘Lab’ suffix in the profile name. These profiles are derived from the related UK Core profile e.g. UKCore-DiagnosticReport-Lab is derived from UKCore-DiagnosticReport.
