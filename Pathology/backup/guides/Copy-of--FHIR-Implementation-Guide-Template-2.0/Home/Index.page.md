This Implementation Guide and the HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup> artefacts that it references define a specification to enable the exchange of pathology laboratory test request and test result data.

The specification supports FHIR versions STU3 and R4. Most of the narrative content of the specification applies to both versions of FHIR with any differences noted accordingly. Version specific FHIR assets (profiles, extensions, examples etc.) are referenced and/or included where appropriate.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-nhse" role="alert">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Unless your implementation is constrained to use FHIR STU3, it is strongly recommended that FHIR R4 is adopted.
</div>

Refer to the {{pagelink:Introduction}} for a description of the scope and structure of the specification, together with an overview of other related pathology products and standards.
