This Implementation Guide and the HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup> artefacts that it references define a specification to enable the exchange of pathology laboratory test request and test result data.

The specification has been created by [NHS England]( https://simplifier.net/organization/NHSDIgital) and forms part of the [NHS England Pathology Project]( https://simplifier.net/pathology).

The profiles that this specification references are derived from the [UK Core Implementation Guide STU2 Release for Ballot]( https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu2/Home?version=1.1.3).

Refer to the {{pagelink:Introduction}} for a description of the scope and structure of the specification, together with an overview of other related pathology products and standards.
