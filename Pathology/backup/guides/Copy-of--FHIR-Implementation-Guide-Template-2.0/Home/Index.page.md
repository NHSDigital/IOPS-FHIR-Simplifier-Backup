<b>IMPORTANT:</b> This Implementation Guide is currently in Draft and SHOULD NOT be used for development or active implementation without consulting the NHS England Pathology Standards and Implementation team.

### Specification Overview
This Implementation Guide and the HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup> R4 artefacts that it references define a specification to enable the exchange of pathology laboratory data.

The specification has been created by [NHS England]( https://simplifier.net/organization/NHSDIgital) and forms part of the [NHS England Pathology Project]( https://simplifier.net/pathology). The profiles that this specification references are derived from the [UK Core Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreversionhistory/home?version=current), currently STU2.

For the version history see {{pagelink:ReleaseNotes}}.

### Pathology Overview
Pathology tests and investigations are critical to many aspects of patient care, supporting the diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and prevention of disease. Pathology comprises a broad range of specialities, each of which includes many individual tests. The key specialities can be grouped as follows:

* blood sciences – this includes clinical biochemistry (also known as chemical pathology), haematology, immunology and transfusion medicine
* microbiology – this includes bacteriology, virology and serology
* cellular pathology – this includes cytology and histopathology
* genetics – this includes clinical cytogenetics and molecular genetics

Pathology tests are requested by a range of care provider organisations in primary care, secondary care and community settings. Within the NHS in England most pathology tests are performed by laboratories based in hospitals. Some pathology laboratories provide specialist and reference pathology testing services, often at a regional level. Over the past few years laboratories have been forming regional pathology networks. 

An increasing number of pathology tests are performed outside of laboratories. These include tests that may be performed at a point of care (usually by a Health Care Professional in a care setting such as a GP practice or in a hospital ward) or by a patient or their carer at home.
