### Data Mapping
A detailed information model, defined as a Microsoft Excel <sup>&reg;</sup> spreadsheet, is available to download from the [Pathology Standards and Implementation work space]( https://nhsengland.kahootz.com/PathologyandDiagnostics/view?objectID=13046960). Refer to the **Pathology Information Model** section of the linked page.

The model extends the high-level {{pagelink:InformationModel}} presented in this specification to provide a detailed mapping between each business entity data item and the corresponding FHIR profile data element. The model also provides a mapping to the corresponding PMIP EDIFACT data items (as defined in the [PMIP EDIFACT](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150107145848/http://www.isb.nhs.uk/documents/isb-1557/amd-39-2003) messaging specification).
