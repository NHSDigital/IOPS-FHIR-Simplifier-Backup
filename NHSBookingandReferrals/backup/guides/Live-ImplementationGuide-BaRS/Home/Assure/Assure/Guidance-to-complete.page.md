## Guidance on completing SCAL

There is [general guidance](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding) regarding the use of the Digital Onboarding Service but the following provides step by step explanation. 

<p>The SCAL is broken down into four key sections, as described in the general guidance above, but section 3 (Technical conformance requirements) verifies the specific BaRS functionality. The section follows the alignment of BaRS products; there is a '<b>Core</b>' (<i>Demonstrate core technical conformance for the BaRS - FHIR API</i>), which every supplier building a BaRS solution must complete, and sections for specific roles. Those specific roles include '<b>Booking Sender</b>' (<i>Demonstrate technical conformance for the BaRS (Booking Sender) - FHIR API</i>) and '<b>111 to ED referral sender</b>' (<i>Demonstrate technical conformance for the BaRS (Referral Sender 111 ED) - FHIR API</i>), for example.</p>


#### Completing a section
Open a section, by clicking the hyperlink, and work through the assessment items.

Certain questions have links to external sources which provide support in answering them.

<p>Progress can be saved at any point, allowing completion of the SCAL in manageable stages. The submission for review by the Solution Assurance team only occurs when a section is explicitly submitted for review, as described under the 'Statuses'.</p>

<p>Once all assessment items are complete within a section the status changes to '<b>Ready to submit</b>' and '<b>Submit for review</b>' displays. Submitting for review is a two step process, click '<b>Submit for review</b>' and then click '<b>Confirm and Submit</b>' when prompted.</p>

<p>The status of the section will change to '<b>Awaiting review</b>', meaning this is now with the Solution Assurance team.</p>

<p><li>If Solution Assurance have reviewed the section it will be marked as either '<b>In Review</b>' or '<b>Review completed</b>'.</li></p>

<p>Work through all sections of the SCAL until each is complete.</p>

#### Providing 'Information required'
