### Overview 

An [NHS England Direction](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/corporate-information-and-documents/directions-and-data-provision-notices/nhs-england-directions/booking-and-referral-standard-direction-2022) to enable NHS Digital to develop an interoperability standard for patient record systems and a related API (Booking and Referral Standard Service) has been published for the BaRS programme. A [record](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/keeping-data-safe-and-benefitting-the-public/gdpr/gdpr-register/booking-and-referral-standard) has also be added to the NHS Digital [GDPR Register](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/keeping-data-safe-and-benefitting-the-public/gdpr) and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is in place. The data that traverses the NHS Digital infrastructure in the form of messages (payload) is a combination of personal data and special category. NHS Digital will only collect BARS API transactional data for the Booking and Referral Standard. Alongside the Standard, an information model has been developed and approved by the Professional Records Standards Body (PRSB) that defines the booking and service request and confirms the data items that will travel with the request. 
Note* NHS England and NHS Digital merged on 1 April 2023.
