We recognise that some solutions may be delivered using integration systems. To ensure the operational value of deploying a BaRS compliant solution and the spirit of the standard [HIMSS interoperability level 4](https://www.himss.org/resources/interoperability-healthcare "HIMSS interoperability level 4") is adhered to, we have developed a set of principles that integration systems should abide by.

In the principles the following terms are referenced:

<b>End User</b> - This is the person performing the necessary actions to initiate, accept or manage a referral or booking.

<b>End user system</b> - this is the healthcare IT system that is being used by the <b>end user</b> to initiate, accept or manage a referral or booking.

<b>Integration system</b> - is any intermediary system that is not part of the <b>end user system</b> that has been built to expose a BaRS compliant API to receive and/or transmit bookings and referrals with a bespoke or proprietary integration with the <b>end user system</b>.

|1| The   end users are unaware that there is an integration system being used (No   screen scraping, No double keying/swivel chair).                                                                                  | The information transmitted to an   end user's system via an integration system is available natively in that   system with sufficient resolution and integrity to be able to complete their   tasks.                                                      |
|3 | The   information transferred through BaRS MUST be able to be used to drive   workflow for the end user.                                                                                                           | A worklist on the end user system   can be ordered according to priority information received by their system.                                                                                                                                             |
|4| Information   must not be modified or lost between the sender and the end user system, in   particular clinical meaning and intent must not be lost or modified in any   way between the sender and the end user.  | A key piece of diagnostic   information (such as a clinical modifier) is not lost through truncation of a   particular field.                                                                                                                              |
|5| The   end user system should be able to consume BaRS referral information in a way   that will support the onward transfer of care.                                                                                | If an end user system needs to   make an onward referral, the BaRS journey ID (episodeofcare.id) is available   to include in that referral (as it has not been lost through   "flattening" of the structure FHIR message).                                |
|6| Business   acknowledgements work as per the design.                                                                                                                                                                | When an integration system   accepts a referral, this completes the process for the sender and is not   reliant on further interop to a downstream system (therefore our synchronous   activity is not obstructed with caching in the integration system). |
|7| Providers   can easily join up their reporting data across the multiple systems involved.                                                                                                                          | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|8| End-to-end   service must be maintained - any issues downstream   of the BaRS connected system are managed by   the BaRS compliant supplier.                                                                       | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|9| End   user systems that send or receive BaRS referrals by an integration system are   not considered BaRS compliant.                                                                                               | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|10| All   information accessed by the end user must be delivered in real-time and be   kept up to date (including not overwriting locally updated information).                                                        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
