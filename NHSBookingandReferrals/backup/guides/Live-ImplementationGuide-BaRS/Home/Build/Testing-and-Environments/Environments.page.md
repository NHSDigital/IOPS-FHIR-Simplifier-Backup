The principle environment for development and testing is the INT (integration) environment. This is a like-live environment, harnessing full security and functionality that can expect to be encountered in Production. In addition, the [BaRS API specification](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir/v1_0_0) links to the Sandbox environment, which is capable of demonstrating the key functionality but without the security overhead.

[Path-to-Live](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments#environments) has full details of all available testing environments and the functionality they offer.
