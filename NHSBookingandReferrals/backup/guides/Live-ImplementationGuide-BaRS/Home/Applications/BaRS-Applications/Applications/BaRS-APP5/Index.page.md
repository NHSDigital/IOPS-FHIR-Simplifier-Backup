## Introduction

### Overview

This page provides guidance for implementing the Referral Standard (BaRS) specifically for the use cases listed above. It should be used alongside the {{pagelink:design-core-1.0.6, text:BaRS Core implementation guide}} and Payload Definitions when developing to the standard. 

### Data model endorsements

The GP to Pharmacy (Pharmacy First) Minor Illness referral information data model is informed by user research with pharmacy service providers. We have engaged with NHS England (NHSE) Policy teams to establish the service information requirements. The data model is based on the Community Pharmacy Standard v3.0 as defined and endorsed by the Professional Records Standards Body (PRSB). The referral information has been validated by the NHSE Pharmacy Clinical Reference Group. This provides the necessary confidence that solutions built to the standard will be both fit for purpose and safe.
