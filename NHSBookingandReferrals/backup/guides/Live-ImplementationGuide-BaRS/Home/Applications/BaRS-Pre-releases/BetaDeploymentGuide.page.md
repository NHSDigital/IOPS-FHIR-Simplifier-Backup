# Beta Deployment Guide

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i><b> Important:</b>
<p>
This page is intended as guidance for all parties involved in BaRS beta deployments. For guidance on stable (V1.0 and above) deployments see {{pagelink:deploy, text:deploy}}.
</p>
</div>


BaRS Applications (the application of the standard to one or more use cases) are being developed following the agile methodology specified in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" target="_blank"> Government Digital Services (GDS) Service Manual</a>. The methodology specifies a <a href= "https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works" target="_blank"> beta phase </a> which is intended as an opportunity to test, learn and iterate the standard collaboratively, first with test, and then with real patient data. This is prior to the publication of a stable (V1.0 and above) version of the standard for widespread use.   

Every BaRS Application needs to be proven in use in a beta phase. During this phase, healthcare IT system suppliers, healthcare providers and NHS England (policy and strategy and the BaRS team) need to work together to deliver specific activities and with the agreed roles and responsibilities described in this document.  

## Who this page is for

This guide describes the key tasks, agreed roles and responsibilities and ways of working for all parties involved in deploying BaRS conformant solutions as part of a new BaRS application throughout the beta phases.  This will involve working with teams across the NHS and supplier landscape and following the activities documented below.   

It is applicable to the following:  

- Healthcare providers  
- Healthcare IT system suppliers    
- BaRS team (NHS England)  
- NHS England Policy and Strategy team (the business area relevant to the use case) 

This guidance does not cover any commercial arrangements between supplier and healthcare provider. 


## Team Charter   

The following team charter outlines the guidelines and expectations for how all parties will work together:  

### Transparency 
All parties will seek to communicate with each other in an open and honest manner and make available the information (as appropriate) and resources that are reasonably required to achieve the aims of the group.  

### Supportive 
All parties will be mindful and protective of the professional reputation of the other organisations. They will act accordingly, resolving any disagreements that may emerge as quickly as possible in a professional manner and agreeing any external communication in relation to such disagreements.  

### Mutual Success
Each organisation will strive to support the success of the other parties involved in the BaRS Application development.  
### Commitment 
All parties will commit to completion of the BaRS Application once they have started.  

### Timescales
Each organisation will endeavour to maintain their development cadence. This is to ensure that all parties (Sending providers and suppliers and receiving suppliers and providers) complete the development at the same time.  

## Acceptance Criteria 

The public beta minimum acceptance criteria for each BaRS Application is determined by the Service Risk Level. This has been agreed with NHS England Clinical Safety Group and recorded in the BaRS Clinical Risk Management Plan. A summary is outlined below. You can find the Service Risk Level for each BaRS application in the <a href= "https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works" target="_blank"> Clinical Safety Case (Appendix A - BaRS Applications) </a>.
 

| Acceptance Criteria                                                                 | Service Risk Level Low | Service Risk Level Medium | Service Risk Level High |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Minimum number of referrals (including responses where relevant)                    | 20                     | 50                       | 75                      |
| Minimum verification period (with no safety-related incidents due to the BaRS implementation) | 14 days                | 28 days                  | 48 days                 |

For the BaRS team to confirm that the beta has successfully completed, a provider will have: 

- Successfully executed all their UAT test plans. 
Completed a minimum number of agreed referrals in line with the BaRS clinical risk management plan. *Note, the referrals could be completed by multiple providers. 
- Completed a period of live running (verification period) proportionate to the level of service risk for the use case. This period must be free from safety related incidents
- Reviewed supporting guidance and shared best practice to support the wider business transformation activity. 


## Key Deployment Activities

A Beta deployment closely mirrors a typical software deployment process but includes multiple opportunities for testing, learning, and iteration.

The diagram below illustrates the steps and stages of the Beta deployment process, with detailed explanations provided in the section that follows.

)

### Business Change

To fully realise the benefits of adopting a BaRS-conformant solution and digitising workflows, providers must carry out business change activities. **Note**: Providers will need access to review the supplier's developed solution, including the user interface and any new functionality, to effectively design the 'future state'. 

- Updating workflows and standard operating procedures
- Staff training and communications plans
- Updating business continuity plans
- Updating any reporting requirements
- Creation, and updating, of information governance and data protection policies
- Undertaking benefits analysis and realization activities e.g.:
    -  identifying any system configuration requirements or additional developments to maximise local efficiencies 

### Private Beta Testing

The provider works alongside their supplier throughout the beta phases with support from NHS England, including the BaRS team. See roles and responsibilities for each group [link] below.

Private beta (also referred to as User Acceptance Testing (UAT)) is a period where providers undertake end-to-end testing of their BaRS conformant solutions, using agreed test scripts, on a non-production or testing environment configured in the same way as the provider’s planned production (live) environment. All workflows documented in the Test Plan must be tested (and pass) within the UAT environment before any upgrades and configuration to the production environment can take place. Test issues are managed to resolution which may result in an update to the BaRS, the supplier’s BaRS conformant solution and/or the provider’s system configuration, depending on the root cause of the issue.

This is the best time to find issues, if they exist, so sufficient resource should be dedicated to ensure thorough testing. Private beta also includes the decision of when to move into public beta.

### Public Beta

Public beta is a period of running the BaRS conformant solutions (sender and receiver) in the providers’ production environments using live patient information. This period is determined according to agreed acceptance criteria which are bespoke to each application (see Section 1.3). The acceptance criteria is defined by the NHS England Clinical Safety Group and agreed for each use case in the BaRS Clinical Risk Management Plan.

Prior to beginning the public beta period, end-to-end ‘smoke testing’ - testing of mission-critical processes, is undertaken on the providers’ production environments, using test patient data. Care must be taken at this stage to limit impact on the live services. The testing must be carried out in live but the service cannot technically go live (and deal with patients) until all functional tests in the Test Plan have been completed successfully.

Evaluation of the public beta phase, led by the NHS England BaRS Team will inform any amendments to the beta standard. Following the required updates, the standard will be uplifted to a ‘stable’ (1.0) version.

### Public Beta to Provider Adoption of V1.0 (stable) Standard

Once a stable version of a BaRS application is published (version 1.0 and above) and NHS England has agreed for progression to full rollout, system suppliers should agree a schedule for development and subsequent rollout with NHS England and individual providers.This will be in line with national and regional policy and may include compliance dates to align with the Information Standards Notice or appropriate procurement frameworks.

For Providers that have participated in the beta phase, further change and training activities may be required alongside testing prior to implementing the uplifted 1.0 and above version of the standard. This should be agreed with system suppliers. The supplier should uplift and deploy this version within 3 months of publication.

Providers implementing a system conformant with the live version of the BaRS application will also need to agree a deployment plan [link to deployment page in IGe] covering business change, training, and testing with their system suppliers.

### Roles and Responsibilities

Roles and responsibilities for each party are described below. A ‘RASCI’ matrix can be found in Section 5.

Delivery partners and stakeholders must know what is expected of them during the beta Phase. This ensures the best chance of success and that time is not wasted through trial-and-error attempts.

There is a requirement to cover these core roles for any beta Phase. There may be others involved or some individuals may perform multiple roles.
