# Payloads for Creating or modifying an endpoint

Describing Endpoints will be facilitated by the Organization, HealthcareService and Endpoint FHIR resources. Each of these are detailed in the below tables. Examples of each are also given. In this model

*  HealthcareServices Belong to an organization.
*  An Organization can be a child Organization of a parent Organization, or Standalone.
*  An Organization can describe a Provider or a Supplier.
*  An Endpoint belongs to a HealthcareService.
	* Multiple Endpoints of the same type are not permitted for a HealthcareService
