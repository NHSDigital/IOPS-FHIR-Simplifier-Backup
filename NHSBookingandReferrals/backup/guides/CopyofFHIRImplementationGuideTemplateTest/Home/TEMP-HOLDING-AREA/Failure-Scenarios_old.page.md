# {{page-title}}

This page defines the foreseen failure scenarios within the BaRS standard and its implementations. The scenarios are broken down by endpoint and describe which HTTP Status Code, BaRS HTTP Error Code and FHIR issue.code to use for each eventuality. In any case, the diagnostics text should reflect the scenarios given and not necessarily be used verbatim.

The rationale, described in the {{pagelink:Home/Design/Core/Error-handling.page.md}} section is that as much information on the nature of the failure as possible is provided in a standard way.

Each scenario has a Source to state whether it is the Proxy or the Receiver which is generating the error. In scenarios where a SEND prefix is provided, the sender is not adhering to the API specification in one way or another.

Note, in future, the PROXY prefix will no longer be used, and errors from the Proxy will use a code with no prefix.

## General Failure Scenarios
This section will define errors that could be seen in any given step and shared from function to function without context. All interactions will follow these rules as such they may be listed in different sections.

## Endpoint Catalogue - Message routing.
Below is a diagram of error locations coupled with scenarios with regards to the routing of messages by the proxy using the Endpoint Catalogue. The below diagram is generic in terms of its not API endpoint specific. Most requests will be subject to the errors that can be encountered during message routing.

{{render:EndpointCatalogue-FailureScenarios.drawio}}

#### SEND at the API
When we use the SEND prefix, it is an issue caught before any internal routing or processing occurs, it usually indicates a problem with the format of the request.

These scenarios can be found in other areas however if more required headers are added for endpoints this may be expanded.

#### REC injected at the proxy

## Check Capabilities GET /metadata
Foreseen failure scenarios are limited for this interaction, in the scope of the receiver. The majority of failures for this stage of workflow is mainly going to be at the sender ascertaining the capabilities of the Receiver and whether they can interact. That would be the purpose of this endpoint though and therefore not considered a failure.

## GET /Slots
Get /Slots has added complexity compared to previous endpoints in this investigation. With a myriad of available and required parameters there is a potential for many scenarios.

#### Rules
* Schedule:actor:HealthcareService - Must be included.
  * For current use cases this will likely match the id in the NHSD-Target-Identifier header. This may not always be the case in future.
* _include - There is a minimum of the following 3 _includes required for current Applications.
  * Slot:schedule
  * Schedule:actor:Practitioner
  * Schedule:actor:HealthcareService
* start - The start parameter must be used twice, and adds the need for handling problematic requests with its use (too wide a time frame, as an example).
  * Must use the [FHIR instant](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#primitive) format which includes and offset.
  * Must be UTC
  * Must have a greater than and a less than.
* status - The status parameter must be used.
  * multiple statuses must be comma separated.
  * FOT allows free or busy.

## GET /MessageDefinition
Message definition includes only one additional parameter and therefore there are less scenarios to cover.

#### Rules
* The context query parameter must be present.
    * For current use cases this will always match the value in the NHSD-Target-Identifier header. This could could not always be the case in future.

#### GET /Appointment
Defined failure scenarios for the GET /Appointment Endpoint. There are two ways to call this endpoint. Either with a query parameter, or a path parameter. This section covers both of those methods.

#### Rules

**GET /Appointment**
* query parameter identifier patient.identifier must be included.
* query parameter identifier patient.identifier must be a system:value. example: https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|4857773456

**GET /Appointment/{id}**
* id in path must be a valid GUID/UUID

#### Interactions
  {{render:Appt-FailureScenarios}}
  
#### Errors by parameter

#### GET /ServiceRequest
Defined failure scenarios for the GET /ServiceRequest Endpoint. Much like GET /Appointment there are two ways to call this endpoint. Either with a query parameter, or a path parameter. This section covers both of those methods.

#### Rules

**GET /ServiceRequest**
* query parameter identifier patient.identifier must be included.
* query parameter identifier patient.identifier must be a system:value. example: https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number|4857773456

**GET /ServiceRequest/{id}**
* id in path must be a valid GUID/UUID

#### Interactions
  {{render:SR-FailureScenarios}}

#### Errors by parameter
**path id in GET /ServiceRequest{id}**

## Message processing POST /$process-message

This section defines unhappy path scenarios for when a receiver processes a message. This includes a reiteration of Transaction Integrity, workflow variable validations and data conflicts.


#### HTTP Headers
Below is a simplified example of how how to handle the Transaction Integrity HTTP headers.
**Logic**
``` c#
{   
    if (HttpHeaders is null || HttpHeaders not Guid )
        OperationOutcome.issue.code = "invalid"
        throw exception with "REC_BAD_REQUEST"
        then return with HTTP.ResponseCode 400
    else if (HttpHeaders.RequestId == RequestId.AlreadyReceived)
        OperationOutcome.issue.code = "duplicate"
        throw exception with "REC_CONFLICT"
        then return with HTTP.ResponseCode 409
}
```
**Visual**

|------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400              | REC_BAD_REQUEST | invalid    | The request headers are not valid.                                |
| 400              | REC_BAD_REQUEST | required   | The request headers are not present.                              |
| 409              | REC_CONFLICT    | duplicate  | The message has been identified as having already been processed. |

**400 OperationOutcome**

      },
      "diagnostics": "Transaction Integrity headers were not present"
    }
  ]
}
```

**409 OperationOutcome**
```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "id": "531e073a-3295-4e67-ae90-e00bd96a9cdd",
  "meta": {

      "diagnostics": "This message has been recognised as having already been successfully processed."

#### Message workflow variable validations

Many scenarios are covered by this one example, the full pseudo code is?

**logic**
```c#
{
		switch(MessageHeader.eventCoding)
		{
			case "servicerequest-request":
				if (MessageHeader.reason.code == "new" && ServiceRequest.status == "active")
					{
						switch(ServiceRequest.Category)
						{
							case "Validation":
								if (CarePlan.status != "active")
								{							
									RequestType = "unknown"
									OperationOutcome.issue.code = "invariant"//A content validation rule failed
									throw exception with "REC_BAD_REQUEST"
									then return  HTTP.ResponseCode 400;
	 						default:
								RequestType = "unknown"
								OperationOutcome.issue.code = "invariant"//A content validation rule failed
								throw exception with "REC_BAD_REQUEST"
								then return  HTTP.ResponseCode 400;
						}
```

|------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400              | REC_BAD_REQUEST | invariant  | A combination of workflow variables has lead to a non-standard or unknown workflow. |

{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",

          }
        ]
      },
      "diagnostics": "A content validation rule failed, Validation message requires a Careplan.satus of 'active'"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Data Conflicts

Receiving an update can present complications under certain conditions if data has been updated locally - for example, If you have updated a record locally prior to an update message being received and a conflict is then encountered. 

**Logic**
``` c#
if (Message == "update")
{
	if (currentLocalData.LastUpdated > originaRequest.ReceivedDate)
	{
		OperationOutcome.issue.code = "conflict"
		throw exception with 'REC_CONFLICT'
		then return with HTTP.ResponseCode 409
		break;
	}	
```

|------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 409              | REC_CONFLICT    | conflict   | local data updates conflict with the updates in the message. |

**409 OperationOutcome**
```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "id": "531e073a-3295-4e67-ae90-e00bd96a9cdd",

          }
        ]
      },
      "diagnostics": "Information received has been updated locally and may cause loss, or presents a conflict, of data"
