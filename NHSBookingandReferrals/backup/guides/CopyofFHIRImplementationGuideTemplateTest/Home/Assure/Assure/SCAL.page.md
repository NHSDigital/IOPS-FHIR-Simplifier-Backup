## SCAL - Supplier Conformance Assessment List 

The process of assurance is driven through the SCAL. 

This is a light-weight, self-assessment document, supported by evidence of the solution's function in the form of log extracts and screenshots etc. The aim is to maintain a low barrier of entry to use the BaRS, allowing both established and start-up healthcare software vendors to participate.

An **end-to-end real-time demonstration** of the solution will be required as part of assurance. This will be witnessed by the BaRS Team, Clinical and Solution Assurance representatives. 

The SCAL is completed [online](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding). There is further guidance on how to complete the SCAL below. 

Request for an **Account Manager** to be set up by sending an email to the BaRS Team <bookingandreferralstandard@nhs.net>, including details of your Organisation, Product and which {{pagelink:Applications, text:BaRS Application}} you are undertaking, and you will be prompted to create an account with [Digital Onboarding Services](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/) via a link. 

### Planning your assurance

When planning a project to build a BaRS solution, the inclusion of assurance must exist from the outset. 

The process of being assured via the SCAL can take between 2-4 weeks (average), from the point of the first complete submission. This allows some time in any plan for resubmissions after review by the Solution Assurance team.  

It is advised the SCAL requirements are reviewed after reading the implementation guidance. The two combined will help build a backlog of requirements for the anticipated solution. For example, there is implementation guidance for {{pagelink:core-EHFailureScenarios-1.1.3, text:error handling}} while the SCAL highlights the expectation for logging and auditing of errors.

Evidence, supporting the completion of the SCAL, can be gathered during testing with other supplier solutions or {{pagelink:Home/Build/Testing-and-Environments/TKW.page.md, text:Toolkit Workbench (TKW)}}. An ideal time to collect is during the end-to-end demonstration of the solution, a necessary part of assurance. The validation reports from TKW must also be submitted as part of the SCAL.
