### Scope Overview

This BaRS Application (Application 2) covers only use cases:
* NHS 111 Online (patient facing service) to ED (Emergency Department)
* NHS 111 Online (patient facing service) to UTC (Urgent Treatment Centre)
* S&R-ED use case
* S&R-UTC use case

The payloads and workflow have been designed to support these services. Other {{pagelink:applications, text:BaRS Applications}} offer scope for alternative use cases.

### Functional Scope
**Service Discovery**
* Establishing a service to direct requests to is a mandatory step in the workflow
* There is no restriction on the service discovery tools used. Any are capable of being supported whether national or proprietary
* The service **must** be configured within the BaRS infrastructure before requests can be made 

**Slot Management**
* Booking slots are the responsibility and ownership of Receivers to maintain and offer to Senders
* All slot requests **must** occur in real-time without caching by either Senders or Receivers
* The returned slots **should** contain sufficient information for Senders to know what they are booking i.e. have a clear 'type', indicate the role and/or gender of the individual performing on behalf of the service, within any given slot

**Booking**
* Allowing bookings for a service is a method of managing capacity 
* A booking may indicate the exact time an individual can expect to be seen, as is traditionally understood when an 'appointment' is made. Alternatively, the booking timeframe could indicate a range through which the individual may be seen by the service
* The slot the booking is made against may also indicate the type of booking e.g. face-to-face or over the phone and the role of the person who will engage with the individual on behalf of the service
* A booking **must** always be accompanied by a referral
* Bookings are an administrative aspect of the workflow and **should <ins>not</ins>** contain clinically pertinent information

**Referral**
* A referral is a request for care on behalf of an individual from one service to another 
* The referral can be sent without prior establish the capacity the service offers
* The referral will contain primarily clinical information, indicating the need of the individual and **should** state the anticipated action required by the Receiving service
* A referral can be made independent of booking but, where a booking is made as part of the same workflow, they **must** be linked
* Key information is expected to be included in a referral, if collected:
    * list of any services rejected prior to the Receiving service being selected, including reason for rejection 

**API-M**
* All requests and response associated with BaRS must occur through the BaRS API Proxy

**Constraints**
* Supporting use of NHS Pathways and NHS Pathways Clinical Content Support (PaCCS) Clinical Decision Support Systems only
* All Service IDs in First of Type (FoT) will be those of Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) Directory of Services (DoS) 
* DoS 'attributes' for controlling Booking into services are to remain honoured (see "how does it work" section below for more information)
* No guidance provided on display of referral information beyond the {{pagelink:principles_prerequesites, text:Principles for rendering BaRS Payload}}. 
* No additional guidance provided on Slot display for Booking 
* Consent within BaRS will be for Direct-Care only 
* Certificates for Receiving messages to use nhs.uk domains only.
* Receiving endpoints are to be internet facing.
* Limited Search Slot parameters for Booking - Schedule.actor:healthcareService, Start (range), (slot) status
* Clincial Constraints exist - See Hazard Log
* No element level updates to requests. A new request must be generated to change information in a booking or referral request
