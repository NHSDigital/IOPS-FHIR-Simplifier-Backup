## Use cases supported

This application supports the use of the following use cases:

* 999 Ambulance Service Trust (AST) validation request to Clinical Assessment Service (CAS)

</br>
</br>

Note: for referral of 999 AST cases with a non-ambulance triage outcome (CAT 5) to a CAS for consultation and treatment and/or onward referral please see {{pagelink:application3}}

## Data model endorsements

The referral information data model is based on user research with NHS 111 service providers, 999 Ambulance Service Trusts, Clinical Assessment Services and clinical and administrative Emergency Department staff.  We carried out this research in parallel with the [Professional Records Standards Body (PRSB)](https://theprsb.org/) who examined the wider brief of 'referrals from NHS 111 to any other care setting' 

For the validation request into a CAS from a 999 AST use case, the data model was endorsed by NHS England following consultation with the [Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE)](https://aace.org.uk/),  National Ambulance Information Group (NAIG), National Ambulance Services Medical Directors' Group (NASMeD) and National Ambulance Digital Leaders Group (NADLG)
