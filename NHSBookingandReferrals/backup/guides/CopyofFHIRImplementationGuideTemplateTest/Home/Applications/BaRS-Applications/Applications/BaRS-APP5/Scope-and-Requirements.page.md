### Scope Overview
This BaRS Application (Referrals into Pharmacy Application 5) supports the following use case ONLY:
- GP to Pharmacy CPCS (Community Pharmacist Consultation Service) for Minor Illness Service

The payload and workflow have been designed to support this service. Other {{pagelink:applications, text:BaRS Applications}} offer scope for alternative use cases.

### Functional Scope
**Service Discovery**
- Establishing a service to direct requests to is a mandatory step in the workflow
- There is no restriction on the service discovery tools used. Any are capable of being supported whether national or proprietary. However, the NHS England Directory of Services supports this application and futher details are provided in the 'Find a Service' section
- The service **must** be configured within the BaRS infrastructure (Endpoint Catalogue) before requests can be made 

**Referral**
- A referral is a request for care, on behalf of an individual, from one service to another 
- The referral can be sent without having to establish the capacity of the receiving service
- The referral will contain primarily clinical information, indicating the need of the individual and **must** state the anticipated action required by the receiving service (see Task FHIR resource)

**API-M**
- All requests and responses associated with BaRS must occur through the BaRS API Proxy

**Constraints**
- All Service IDs in First of Type (FoT) will be those from the Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) Directory of Services (DoS) 
- No guidance is provided on the display of referral information beyond the {{pagelink:principles_prerequesites, text:Principles for rendering BaRS Payload}}.
- Consent within BaRS will be for Direct-Care only 
- Certificates for Receiving messages to use nhs.uk domains only.
- Receiving endpoints are to be internet facing.
- Clincial Constraints exist - See Hazard Log
- No element level 'updates' to requests are supported. A new request must be generated to change information in the referral request
- Reduce Scope and Requirements for beta phase to support delivery timeline
