To support the workflows for this application of the standard the operations that need to be supported are:

### Find a Service

The BaRS referral process as shown above does not include guidance on how a user should determine if a referral to Pharmacy is appropriate for the patient.  It is the responsibility of the referring organisaton to ensure patients are pre-screened by GP Practice staff (care navigators or clinicians) prior to beginning the referral process, using their own judgement or an appropriate triage tool.  

#### Directory of Services API

Pharmacy services are profiled on the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/directory-of-services-dos" target="_blank">Directory of Services (DoS).</a>

For this application, systems should use the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/directory-of-services-urgent-and-emergency-care-rest" target="_blank">Directory of Services - Urgent and Emergency Care - REST API.</a>

Details on how to develop to use this API and onboard to use it in production, are provided in the links above.

For this application the Service Type search will be used:
<a href="https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/dos-api/byServiceType.html" target="_blank">Search by Service Type | docs-dos-api (developer.nhs.uk).</a>


#### Guidance on how to call the DoS API

This API supports a search by location (e.g. the patient's current location).  Note that the DoS API used does not support the concept of searching for services that are open within a given timeframe, however the results from DOS include all opening times. The service search results should be filtered to those that are open in the timeframe required for the referral.  The filtered results should be displayed back to the user, in order to allow them to choose with the patient where they want to go.

The search parameters to be used are as follows:

When a service is chosen, the "Service ID" field in the DOS data will be used as the Receiver Service Identifier to then initiate the referral as per the following sections.

### Make a Referral

Making a referral for this application follows the {{pagelink:core-standardpattern, text:standard pattern for BaRS operations}}.

The message definition that defines this payload for this application is: {{link:MessageDefinition-BARS-MessageDefinition-ServiceRequest-Request-Referral}}

In addition to that the specific workflow parameters that are required are as follows:

                        <td>MessageHeader (ReasonCode) = new</td>

            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>

Additionally the HTTP request header would be:

```
NHSD-Target-Identifier = {Receiver Service Identifier}
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000001>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
NHSD-End-User-Organisation = {FHIR Organisation (Base64 Encoded)}
NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR Practitioner (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}
```

The HTTP response header would be:

```
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000001>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
```

### Cancel a Referral

To cancel a referral this application follows the {{pagelink:core-standardpattern, text:standard pattern for BaRS operations}} with an additional step. Before beginning the standard pattern as descbribed on the linked section, the referral **sender** must perform a read of the referral to be cancelled, from the referral **receiver**, prior to cancellation to ensure they are working with the most up-to date information and it has not already been actioned. This is done by performing a "GET ServiceRequest by ID" call to the **receiving** system's corresponding API endpoint (via the BaRS proxy).

The response to this request will be the requested ServiceRequest resource which should be checked for its current status to ensure it does not already have a status of "revoked" or "completed". If not, this version of the ServiceRequest should be used when re-submitting the modified resource in the POST bundle as described in the {{pagelink:core-standardpattern, text:standard pattern}}.

The message definition that defines this payload for this application is: {{link:messagedefinition-barsmessagedefinitionservicerequestrequestcancelled}}

As a general princple, when performing an update type of operation (of which cancellation is a special case), only the focus resource, any resources that are mandated due to contextual, linking or referential integrity reasons and any resources that include elements that are being changed, **should** be include. This is always defined within the relevent message definition.

If the update-to-cancel is taking place as part of a re-referral routine, once the cancellation is complete, the new referral message can be sent. This step in the workflow would follow the same process as 'Make a referral' detailed above.

In addition the specific workflow parameters that are required are as follows:

                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>

Additionally the HTTP request header for the **GET ServiceRequest** would be:

```
NHSD-Target-Identifier = {Receiver Service Identifier}
X-Request-Id = <GUID_107>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_108>
NHSD-End-User-Organisation = {FHIR Organisation (Base64 Encoded)}
NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR Practitioner (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}
```

The HTTP response header for the **GET ServiceRequest** would be:

```
X-Request-Id = <GUID_107>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_108>
```

the HTTP request header for the **POST $process-message** would be:

```
NHSD-Target-Identifier = {Receiver Service Identifier}
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000003>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
NHSD-End-User-Organisation = {FHIR Organisation (Base64 Encoded)}
NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR Practitioner (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}
```

The HTTP response header for the **POST $process-message** would be:

```
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000003>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
```
