### Scope Overview

This BaRS Application (Application 6) covers three use cases:
* CAD to CAD Out of Area referral 
* CAD to CAD Call Assist Request
* CAD to CAD Mutual Aid Request

For the public beta phase ONLY the CAD to CAD Out of Area referral use case is **mandatory**.

The payloads and workflow have been designed to support these services. Other {{pagelink:applications, text:BaRS Applications}} offer scope for alternative use cases.

### Functional Scope

**Service Discovery**

* Establishing a service to direct requests to is a mandatory step in the workflow
* There is no restriction on the service discovery tools used. Any are capable of being supported whether national or proprietary
* The service **must** be configured within the BaRS infrastructure (Endpoint Catalogue) before requests can be made to the service
* For CAD to CAD Out of Area referrals the Home AST **should** be selected using the incident location and nationally agreed polygons

**Referral** 
* A referral Sender **must** interpret the Message Definition returned by the Receiver to check what use cases are supported before attempting to send a referral.
* Referral Sender **must** ONLY send a use case specific referral that match the use context supported by the Receiver i.e. MessageDeinition.useContext where the system value = usecases-categories-bars is mutualaidrequest or callassistrequest or outofareareferral.  
* A referral is a request for care on behalf of an individual from one service to another 
* The referral can be sent without having to establish the capacity the service offers
* The referral Sender **must** have the capability to send a referral at points in the call cycle that are appropriate for the acuity of the case
* The referral Sender **must** include incident location information
* The referral will contain primarily clinical information, indicating the need of the individual and **should** state the anticipated action required by the Receiving service
* Supporting information, other than the assessment, is expected to be included in a referral, if collected, including:
    * new or existing safeguarding concerns
    * locally held Special Patient Notes
    * external information sources used during initial assessment prior to referral
    * scene safety information
    * timing information to support the timely delivery of care and reporting
* For Call Assist and Mutual Aid requests the referral can be rejected by the referral Receiver if they can't meet the requirements specified in the request

**Referral Response (Status Update)**
* A referral response is sent by the referral Receiver back to the referral Sender to notify them of the current status of the case
* A Referral response update is used to communicate each change in status
* For Call Assist and Mutual Aid requests, the referral rejection is communicated in a referral response
* The Receiver **must** send a Referral Response to the referral Sender each time the Encounter Status changes

**API-M**
* All requests and responses associated with BaRS **must** occur through the BaRS API Proxy

**Constraints**
* Supporting the use of Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group (ECPAG) approved Clinical Decision Support Systems only (NHS Pathways, NHS Pathways Clinical Content Support (PaCCS) and Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS))
* No guidance provided on display of referral information beyond the {{pagelink:principles_prerequesites, text:Principles for rendering BaRS Payload}}
* BaRS currently supports the communication of consent for direct care only
* Certificates for Receiving messages to use nhs.uk domains only
* Receiving endpoints are to be internet facing
* Clinical Constraints exist - See Hazard Log

### Population of address fields
Consistent population of address fields can improve interoperability by reducing the erroneous rejection of cases where the address is correct but information is in a different address field than is expected by the receiver. The FHIR address fields used in this BaRS application are:
* **Patient.address**
* **IncidentLocation.address**
* **Location.address**

This will be discussed with suppliers, providers and FHIR experts, as part of the alpha review, and agreed guidance incorporated into the beta version of this application.
<br>
<br>
### Audit
* Sufficient information around any activity through the API and subsequent BaRS workflow **must** be persisted to aid support incidents and audit requirements
<br>
<br>
### Error Handling 
* Suppliers **must** adhere to the {{pagelink:core-ErrorHandling, text:error handling guidance}} 
<br>
<br>
### Non Functional 
* Suppliers **must** adhere to the {{pagelink:core-NFR, text:non functional requirements}}
