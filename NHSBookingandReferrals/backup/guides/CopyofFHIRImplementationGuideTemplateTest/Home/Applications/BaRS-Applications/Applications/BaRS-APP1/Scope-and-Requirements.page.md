### Scope Overview
This BaRS Application (Application 1) covers only use cases:
* 111 (telephony) to ED (Emergency Department)
* 111 (telephony) to UTC (Urgent Treatment Centre)
* IUC CAS (Integrated Urgent Care Clinical Assessment Service) to ED (Emergency Department)
* IUC CAS (Integrated Urgent Care Clinical Assessment Service) to UTC (Urgent Treatment Centre)

The payloads and workflow have been designed to support these services. Other {{pagelink:applications, text:BaRS Applications}} offer scope for alternative use cases.

### Functional Scope
**Service Discovery**
* Establishing a service to direct requests to is a mandatory step in the workflow
* There is no restriction on the service discovery tools used. Any are capable of being supported whether national or proprietary
* The service **must** be configured within the BaRS infrastructure (Endpoint Catalogue) before requests can be made 

**Slot Management**
* Booking slots are the responsibility and ownership of Receivers to maintain and offer to Senders
* All slot requests **must** occur in real-time without caching by either Senders or Receivers
* The returned slots **should** contain sufficient information for Senders to know what they are booking i.e. have a clear 'type', indicate the role and/or gender of the individual performing on behalf of the service, within any given slot

**Booking**
* Allowing bookings for a service is a method of managing capacity 
* A booking may indicate the exact time an individual can expect to be seen by or is expected to arrive at the service, as is traditionally understood when an 'appointment' is made. Alternatively, the booking timeframe could indicate a range through which the individual may be seen by the service
* The slot the booking is made against may also indicate the type of booking e.g. face-to-face or over the phone and the role of the person who will engage with the individual on behalf of the service
* Bookings are an administrative aspect of the workflow and **should <ins>not</ins>** contain clinically pertinent information

**Referral**
* A referral is a request for care on behalf of an individual from one service to another 
* The referral can be sent without having to establish the capacity the service offers
* The referral will contain primarily clinical information, indicating the need of the individual and **should** state the anticipated action required by the Receiving service
* A referral can be made independent of booking but, where a booking is made as part of the same workflow, they **must** be linked
* Supporting information, other than the assessment, is expected to be included in a referral, if collected, including:
    * new or existing safeguarding concerns
    * locally held Special Patient Notes
    * external information sources used during initial assessment prior to referral
    * list of any services rejected prior to the Receiving service being selected, including reason for rejection 


**API-M**
* All requests and response associated with BaRS must occur through the BaRS API Proxy

**Constraints**
* Supporting use of NHS Pathways and NHS Pathways Clinical Content Support (PaCCS) Clinical Decision Support Systems only
* All Service IDs in First of Type (FoT) will be those of Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) Directory of Services (DoS) 
* DoS 'attributes' for controlling Booking into services are to remain honoured (see "how does it work" section below for more information)
* No guidance provided on display of referral information beyond the {{pagelink:principles_prerequesites, text:Principles for rendering BaRS Payload}}.
* No additional guidance provided on Slot display for Booking 
* Consent within BaRS will be for Direct-Care only 
* Certificates for Receiving messages to use nhs.uk domains only.
* Receiving endpoints are to be internet facing.
* Limited Search Slot parameters for Booking - Schedule.actor:healthcareService, Start (range), (slot) status
* Clincial Constraints exist - See Hazard Log
* No element level 'updates' to requests. A new request must be generated to change information in a booking or referral request
