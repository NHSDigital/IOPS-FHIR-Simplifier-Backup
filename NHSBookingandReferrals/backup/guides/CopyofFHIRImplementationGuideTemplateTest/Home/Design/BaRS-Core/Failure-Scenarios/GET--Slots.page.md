## GET /Slots
Get /Slots has added complexity compared to previous endpoints in this section. With a myriad of available and required parameters there is a potential for many scenarios.

### Rules
* Schedule:actor:HealthcareService - Must be included.
  * For current use cases this will likely match the value in the NHSD-Target-Identifier header. This may not always be the case in future.
* _include - There is a minimum of the following 3 _includes required for current Applications.
  * Slot:schedule
  * Schedule:actor:Practitioner
  * Schedule:actor:HealthcareService
* start - The start parameter must be used twice, and adds the need for handling problematic requests with its use (too wide a time frame, as an example).
  * Must use the [FHIR instant](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#primitive) format which includes and offset.
  * Must be UTC
  * Must have a greater than and a less than.
* status - The status parameter must be used.
  * multiple statuses must be comma separated.
  * FOT allows free or busy.
