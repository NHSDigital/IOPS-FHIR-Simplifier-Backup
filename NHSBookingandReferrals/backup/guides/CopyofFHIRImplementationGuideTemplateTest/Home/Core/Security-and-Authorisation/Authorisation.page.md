## Authorisation

BaRS will use several HTTP headers to facilitate authorisation. Although optional, receivers can expect these to be present for each request (excluding /metadata and /MessageDefinition), where applicable, to enforce access control. These will be in addition to the X-Request-ID and the X-Correlation-ID headers. If the information in these headers is available in the sending system, they'll be included in the request.

Each of these HTTP headers are objects and will therefore need to be added in the form of a standard Base64 encoded string.

Examples of each HTTP header item can be found within the [API Specification](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir).
