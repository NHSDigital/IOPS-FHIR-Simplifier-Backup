| Deployment                   | Solution providers release a new major version of their Booking and Referral APIs alongside a previous major version, until such time as consumers have migrated to the new major version. Alternatively, there is support for backward compatibility of requests to support consumers. Solution providers release a new minor or patch version, replacing the previous minor or patch version The Booking and Referral endpoints are independently deployable against unique Fully Qualified Domain Names (FDQN). This ensures support for limitations around sending and receiving messages between path-to-live and production environments. To increase availability, during upgrades and maintenance, the Booking and Referral APIs are load balanced across multiple servers In multi tenanted deployments, the activity of individual tenants are readily distinguishable |
