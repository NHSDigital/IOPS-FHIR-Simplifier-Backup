https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/UKCore-MedicationStatement

Defines the UK Core constraints and extensions on the MedicationStatement resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve medication statement information.

This profile allows exchange of a record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A MedicationStatement may indicate that the individual may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future. The source of this information can be the individual, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.
