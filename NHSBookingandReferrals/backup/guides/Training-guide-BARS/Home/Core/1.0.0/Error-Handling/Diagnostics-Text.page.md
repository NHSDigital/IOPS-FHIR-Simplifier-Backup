### Diagnostics text

The purpose of the two code values are to give high level information as to the nature and source of an error response. The diagnostics text is to contain clear and concise information regarding the exact cause of the problem encountered, where possible. This should include information on the problem encountered, internal debug details such as error message and texts are encouraged, exposing stack traces is not. The diagnostics field does not include any patient identifiable information at any time.
