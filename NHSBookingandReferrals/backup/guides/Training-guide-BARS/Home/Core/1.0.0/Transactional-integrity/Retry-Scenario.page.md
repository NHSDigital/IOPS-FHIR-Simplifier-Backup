## Retry scenario

Should a request fail for any reason and the sender not receive a response (in any of the above scenarios) the sender is to retry the request, retaining the same X-Request-ID and X-Correlation-ID as the initial attempt. This allows the receiver to identify whether it has already processed this message or not.

This satisfies the need to be able to handle transaction integrity, and for the most part auditing/logging. There are two more scenarios that need to be clarified:

- onwards referrals
- sending a booking and referral

The proposal is to retain the X-Correlation-ID for two separate and distinct messages concerning the same encounter or case.
