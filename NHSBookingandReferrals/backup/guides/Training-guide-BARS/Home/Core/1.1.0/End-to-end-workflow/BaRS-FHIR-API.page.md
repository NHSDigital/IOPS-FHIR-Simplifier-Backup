## BaRS FHIR API

The [BaRS FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir/v1_0_0) supports all functionality with receiver APIs for both booking and referrals. Once an access token has been obtained, the sender can start making requests of the API. 

Note: With every API request the sender must include the HTTP header parameter 'NHSD-Target Identifier'. 

You can find details for each endpoint in the [API Specification](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/booking-and-referral-fhir/v1_0_0).
