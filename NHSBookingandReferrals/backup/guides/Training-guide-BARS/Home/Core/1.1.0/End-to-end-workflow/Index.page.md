# {{page-title}}

This section covers the core elements of workflow outlined within the Booking and Referral Standard. There are two caveats when reading this:

- Workflow is dependent on its Application or use case, for example in 999 - CAS validation, there is no step to perform a booking. See the relevant use case page in the 
{{pagelink:applications, text:BaRS Applications}} section. 


- The order of workflow is interchangeable. It is possible to:
    - make a referral before a booking
    - refer without booking
    - book without referring
