## REST 

FHIR is often associated with REST (REpresentational State Transfer) as a primary method of exchange. BaRS uses REST for many of the benefits it offers - 

- allows independent modular development of client and server APIs (they don't need to know about each other before exchanges)
- easy to integrate because of common agreed standards
- scalability in developing and performance 

In BaRS, simple CRUD operations on single resources is used for discrete atomic functions, such as retrieving a known booking or referral entity.
