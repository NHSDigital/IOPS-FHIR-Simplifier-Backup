#### BARS MessageDefinition ServiceRequest-Request Referral

When making a request to transfer a patient to a service the BARSMessageDefinition-ServiceRequest-Request Referral Message Definition is used to define how the bundle should be built.

This Message Definition is built with the following specific values:

| FHIR   Element         | Cardinality | Element Guidance                                    | Additional Guidance                              |

## Referral Request workflow

When building a bundle from this message definition the following resources are included:

{{render:bars-map-servicerequest-request-referral}}

<hr>

As can be seen from the diagram, the bundle is made up of the following resources:

#### {{pagelink:Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/AllProfiles/BARSBundleMessage.guide.md}}

| FHIR   Element | Cardinality | Element Guidance                              | Additional Guidance                                                       |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type           | 1..1        | fixed value "message"                         | The bundle type further expects the next resource to be a   MessageHeader |
| timestamp      | 1..1        | The   date/time that the bundle was assembled |                                                                           |

{{tree:https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/BARSBundleMessage, hybrid}}

<hr>

#### {{pagelink:Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/AllProfiles/BARSMessageHeader-ServiceRequest-Request.guide.md}}

The MessageHeader resource carries information such as the sender and receiver as is a wrapper for the message. The event.system and event.code will match the MessageDefinition corresponding values. The definition element has a direct link to the MessageDefinition that will be used to check validation of the Bundle contents.
