| Data retention               | The Solution audits all API access attempts and actions, retaining all pertinent data therein                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Deployment                   | Solution providers release a new major version of their Booking and Referral APIs alongside a previous major version, until such time as consumers have migrated to the new major version. Alternatively, there is support for backward compatibility of requests to support consumers. Solution providers release a new minor or patch version, replacing the previous minor or patch version The Booking and Referral endpoints are independently deployable against unique Fully Qualified Domain Names (FDQN). This ensures support for limitations around sending and receiving messages between path-to-live and production environments. To increase availability, during upgrades and maintenance, the Booking and Referral APIs are load balanced across multiple servers In multi tenanted deployments, the activity of individual tenants are readily distinguishable |



The following Processing time SLAs describe the need for APIs to respond to a request within an acceptable time frame. This time frame should be measured from when a request is received and does not include the transport time.
These times are guide for average response time.

| item | Requirement.                                                                                                                                                   |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 90% of requests SHOULD take less than 2100ms to process. (Allowing for response time depending on measurement point). $process-message independently measured. |
| 2    | All requests MUST take less than 5000ms to process.                                                                                                            |
| 3    | Any requests not processed within 5000ms should be timed out with "408 - REC_TIMEOUT - timeout"                                                                |
