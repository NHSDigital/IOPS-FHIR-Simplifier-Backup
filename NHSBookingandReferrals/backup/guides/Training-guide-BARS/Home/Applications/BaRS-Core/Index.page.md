BaRS consists of BaRS Core that provides a core set of functionality and BaRS Applications that provide distinct functionality for each use case.

You will find here a set of documentation, specifications and services that describe and support all the fundamental components of the standard that are always the same for all use cases or care journeys. Examples include the underlying capabilities and patterns and transport layer elements such as security, authorisation and access control.
