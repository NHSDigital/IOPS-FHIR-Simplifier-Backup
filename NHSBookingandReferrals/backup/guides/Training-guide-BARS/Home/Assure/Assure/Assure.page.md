Assurance is central to building a BaRS solution, inherent in both documentation and tooling. 

The assurance process exists to ensure solutions are compliant with the Standard and robust enough to interoperate with each other in a Live environment. The rationale for stringent assurance is to ensure solutions who have never engaged before will work with each other. BaRS is a truly interoperable Standard that will work across many areas of the Health & Care space and certain solutions may interact infrequently.
