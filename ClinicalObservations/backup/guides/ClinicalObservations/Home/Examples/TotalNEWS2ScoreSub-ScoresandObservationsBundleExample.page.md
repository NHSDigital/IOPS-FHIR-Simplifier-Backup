## Total NEWS 2 Score, Sub-Scores and Observations Bundle Example

[Example](#Example)

## Scenario

### Background
Mr Smith is 52-year-old gentleman who attends the Emergency Department of his local hospital with a fever, cough and pleuritic pain with following vitals:

    Respiratory rate: 21/min
    Oxygen saturation : 93%
    On air
    Systolic blood pressure: 120 mmHg
    Heart rate : 95/min
    Consciousness: Alert
    Temperature: 37.5 C

These observed vitals are each allocated a score, as they are measured. This forms the basis of the NEWS 2 scoring system, with the magnitude of the score reflecting how extremely these vitals varies from the norm. The score is then aggregated.  Mr Smith's vitals are recorded as a NEWS 2 score of 6. Since this is a NEWS 2 score of 5 or more, this is the trigger level for an urgent clinical response.  The Emergency Department Consultant, Dr Paul Rastall, who is responsible for Mr Smith's care, ensures that the appropriate medical intervention is made as this NEWS 2 score is a strong indicator of increased risk of serious clinical deterioration and mortality in patient with acute medical illnesses. 

In this scenario the total NEWS 2 Score, sub-scores and vital signs observations are recorded.
