# Clinical Observations
## Early Warning Scores

This Implementation Guide is in support of a project to develop and mature the standards for observations data capture. The aim is to share observations along the patient pathway and across organisational boundaries.  The proposed design is a generic approach to clinical observations and Early Warning Scores (EWS).

The specification supports sharing of EWS final score and associated Vital Signs and their sub-scores from Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) to third party applications.

Other possible use cases where this specification might apply include:

- Hospital to hospital patient transfer

- A vital signs app to an Electronic Patient Record in a hospital 

- Ambulance to Emergency Department 

- Hospital look up of observations in GP systems. This will enable hospitals to import the Vital Signs observations from GP Systems to build a single record of observations around a patient, to provide a baseline and trends available to all. 

- Ambulance recording on remote devices and communicating to central ambulance record 

- GP to Ambulance
