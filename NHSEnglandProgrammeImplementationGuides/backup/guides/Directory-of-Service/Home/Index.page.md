## What is Directory of Service (DoS)?

The DoS is a directory of NHS services available to a Patient.

Once someone has gone through a triage the DoS provides information about where they should go next.

The DoS uses the information already collected about the patient – such as their location and how quickly they need treatment – to provide a list of the best services for them. For example, this might be the nearest pharmacy, an urgent treatment centre or an emergency department.

The list is ranked by factors such as how close the facility is, when it is open and what services are available when they get there.

## What is the Aim of this Implementation Guide? ##

This implementation guide provides guidance on implementing the Directory of Service (DoS) FHIR R4 Standard.

Guidance is given around two approaches to a DoS system. The first approach is searching for an approriate service, then second is to check availability of the service. In order to make an Appointment/Booking.

### Searching

1) A patient searches for a service: "Where can I find physiotherapy in my area?"

2) The system shows organizations, their locations, and offered healthcare services.

### Booking

1) A patient searches for an appointment with a GP.

2) The system displays available locations and services.

3) The user can see Schedules and book specific Slots.
