## What is Directory of Service (DoS)?

The DoS is a directory of NHS services available to a Patient.

Once someone has gone through a triage the DoS provides information about where they should go next.

The DoS uses the information already collected about the patient – such as their location and how quickly they need treatment – to provide a list of the best services for them. For example, this might be the nearest pharmacy, an urgent treatment centre or an emergency department.

The list is ranked by factors such as how close the facility is, when it is open and what services are available when they get there.
