The Multi-cancer Early Detection Test Report message allows GPs, and other interested parties, to receive the Multi-cancer Early Detection screening results in a FHIR format that conforms to the proposed pathology R4 guidance, and [UK Core](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu3-sequence?version=1.7.0).
 
The Multi-cancer Early Detection screening results message uses a variety of FHIR resources that can be found on the {{pagelink:Home/FHIR-Assets/All-Assets}} page. The design conforms to NHS England's Pathology test report pattern.
