## <a id="BodySiteMap"></a>Body site mapping to SNOMED CT

Body sites should be drawn from the Body Structure hierarchy within SNOMED ( \< 123037004 \| Body structure (body structure) ). The body structure suspected as part of a multi-cancer early detection test is recorded in the component Backbone element of the Observation resource that is either the primary or secondary recorded site. Sometimes there may be multiple body sites detected for a primary or secondary cancer signals. In these cases, multiple component Backbone elements should be recorded within the Observation.

For example, for a single body site for a cencer signal detected in the prostate, a single Observation.component should be recorded. In the following snippets not all the Observation elements are shown.
