As part of the BI & Data Analytics product, we aim to integrate closed episode information from the BS Select into the National Screening platform (NPS). This involves acquiring the data related to the Episode and Participant/Subject from BS-select.  Subsequently we are analyzing the best approach / standards to follow to consume this data from BS-select and expose the data assets to CDP or downstream applications.

As part of the TDA's and other forums,there are suggestions to look into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards use and implementation in NPS.

As part of analysis, we are evaluating the Episode and Subject entity attributes high level mapping with FHIR standard entities.
