## What is FGM-IS?

Launched by the Department of Health (DH) and NHS England at the Girl Summit in July 2014, the Female Genital Mutilation - Information Sharing (FGM-IS) provides a national IT system for healthcare professionals and administrative staff to record that a child with female genitalia has a family history of FGM.

The FGM-IS supports the early intervention and ongoing safeguarding of children with female genitalia, under the age of 18, who have a family history of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).

The service supports the sharing of FGM information, and allows authorised healthcare professionals and administrative staff throughout England to view information about girls with a family history of FGM, regardless of care setting.

The service facilitates sharing local data nationally, removing the need for organisations to create duplicate copies of information across systems and by enabling access to up to date information directly from one central repository.

Authorised healthcare workers can access FGM-IS either via the <a href ='https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-care-records-service' class="external"> National Care Record Service (NCRS)</a> or via a local point-of-care application.

Authorised healthcare workers can:
- query to determine if a patient has a FGM family history indicator
- create a FGM family history indicator for a patient
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - must be gender ‘female’, ‘unknown’ or indeterminate’ according to PDS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - must be under the age of 18 according to PDS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - must not already have a FGM family history indicator on FGM-IS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - must have a verified NHS number<br>
- delete a FGM family history indicator for a patient

The FGM-IS contains:

- an indicator that a child with female genitalia has a family history of FGM
- the date that the FGM assessment was carried out

This implementation guide provides guidance on implementing the FHIR R4 version of the FGM-IS API. A design overview for the FGM-IS FHIR R4 API can be found here: {{pagelink:Home/Design/Designoverview.page.md}}
