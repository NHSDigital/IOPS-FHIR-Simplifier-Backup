| [HL7 International Patient Access (IPA)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa/)  or [IHE Query for Existing Data for Mobile (QEDm)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/QEDm/branches/master/index.html) | This specification describes how an application acting on behalf of a patient can access information about the patient from a clinical records system using a FHIR R4 based API. The clinical records system may be supporting a clinical care provider (e.g., a hospital or a general practitioner), a health data exchange, or other system managing patient records, including a national health record system. | [INTEROPen and NHS England Care Connect API](https://nhsconnect.github.io/CareConnectAPI/) |
| [IHE Mobile access to Health Documents (MHD)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/index.html) | The Mobile access to Health Documents (MHD) Profile defines one standardized interface to health document sharing (a.k.a. an Application Programming Interface (API)) for use by mobile devices so that deployment of mobile applications is more consistent and reusable. In this context, mobile devices include tablets, smart-phones, and embedded devices including home-health devices. This profile is also applicable to more capable systems where needs are simple, such as pulling the latest summary for display. The critical aspects of the “mobile device” are that it is resource-constrained, has a simple programming environment (e.g., JSON, JavaScript), simple protocol stack (e.g., HTTP), and simple display functionality (e.g., HTML browser). The goal is, in part, to avoid burdening the client with additional libraries such as those that are necessary to process SOAP, WSSE, MIME-Multipart, MTOM/XOP, ebRIM, and multi-depth XML. | [IHE XDS](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Cross-Enterprise_Document_Sharing) and  [INTEROPen and NHS England Care Connect API](https://nhsconnect.github.io/CareConnectAPI/) |
| [IHE Patient Demographics Query for Mobile (PDQm)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PDQm/) | The Patient Demographics Query for Mobile (PDQm) Profile defines a lightweight RESTful interface to a patient demographics supplier leveraging technologies readily available to mobile applications and lightweight browser based applications. | [Patient Demographics Query (PDQ)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-8.html) and [HSCIC ITK - HL7v2 Interoperability Message Specifications](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRkyZvWpZB1nCKbvQbo-eW_q9VtlR3Ws) |
