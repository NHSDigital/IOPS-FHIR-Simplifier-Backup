| **Patient Encounter Notification** e.g. {{pagelink:Home/Volume-2/Sending-Encounter-Event-Notifications-CIC-5.page.md}} | Is a HL7 FHIR based method for notifying other providers (and applications) of key health administrative events along a pathway. It is compatible with HL7 v2 ADT, [IHE Patient Administration Managment](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-14.html) and (NHS England) HSCIC ITK - HL7v2 Interoperability Message Specifications. This is not intended to replace HL7 v2 usage within a secondary care organisation but rather extend this notification to other sectors, i.e. a HL7 v2 ADT/IHE PEM can be easily transformed into a HL7 FHIR Patient Encounter Notification. | [IHE Patient Administration Managment](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-14.html) and [HSCIC ITK - HL7v2 Interoperability Message Specifications](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRkyZvWpZB1nCKbvQbo-eW_q9VtlR3Ws) |
| [IHE Patient Identifier Cross-referencing for mobile (PIXm)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PIXm/index.html) | The Patient Identifier Cross-reference for Mobile (PIXm) Profile provides RESTful transactions for mobile and lightweight browser-based applications to create, update and delete patient records in a Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager and to query the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager for a patient’s cross-domain identifiers. | [IHE Patient Administration Managment](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-14.html) and [HSCIC ITK - HL7v2 Interoperability Message Specifications](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRkyZvWpZB1nCKbvQbo-eW_q9VtlR3Ws) |
| [IHE Patient Master Identity Registry (PMIR)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PMIR/) | The Patient Master Identity Registry (PMIR) Profile supports the creating, updating and deprecating of patient master identity information about a subject of care, as well as subscribing to changes to the patient master identity, using the HL7 FHIR standard resources and RESTful transactions. In PMIR, “patient identity” information includes all information found in the FHIR Patient Resource such as identifier, name, phone, gender, birth date, address, marital status, photo, others to contact, preference for language, general practitioner, and links to other instances of identities. The “patient master identity” is the dominant patient identity managed centrally among many participating organizations (a.k.a., “Golden Patient Identity”). | [IHE Patient Administration Managment](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-14.html) and [HSCIC ITK - HL7v2 Interoperability Message Specifications](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRkyZvWpZB1nCKbvQbo-eW_q9VtlR3Ws) |
| [IHE Document Subscription for Mobile (DSUBm)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/DSUBm/index.html)  | The Document Subscription for Mobile (DSUBm) Profile describes the use of document subscription and notification mechanisms for RESTful applications. In a similar way to the DSUB Profile, a subscription is made in order to receive a notification when a document publication event matches the criteria expressed in the subscription. |
