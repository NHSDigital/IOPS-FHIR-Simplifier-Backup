## Introduction

The Patient Access Query Reporting (PAQR) Service, previously known as the Subject Access Reporting (SAR) service within Spine, is a specialised reporting service that documents how and when patient data has been accessed. PAQR supports data guardians, such as privacy officers, in tracking and monitoring access requests to patient records.
