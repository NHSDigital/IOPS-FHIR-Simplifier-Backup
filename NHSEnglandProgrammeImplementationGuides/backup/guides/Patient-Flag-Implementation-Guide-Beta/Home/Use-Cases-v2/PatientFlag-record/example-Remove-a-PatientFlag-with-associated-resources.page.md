# Remove Patient Flag Associated Resources

This page describes how a Practitioner removes associated resources (e.g., additional details, conditions) from a Patient Flag record via the PatientFlag FHIR API.

## üìò Overview

Patient Flags are used to track important clinical information about patients, such as allergies, conditions, or adjustments. In some cases, associated resources like conditions or adjustments may need to be removed or updated. This process ensures that the information related to the flag is properly maintained.

For system-level context, see [Home](Home).

## ü©∫ Use Case

A Practitioner removes associated resources from a Patient Flag record. This includes resources such as conditions or adjustments linked to the flag, and can be done via the FHIR API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

### Frequency of Use
- As needed when a practitioner needs to remove associated resources from a Patient Flag record.

### Trigger
- Practitioner decides to remove an associated resource for a patient.

### Pre-conditions
- Practitioner has identified the Patient Flag and associated resources.
- Practitioner is authorized to delete these resources.

### Post-conditions
- Associated resources are successfully deleted.
- The Patient Flag record is updated accordingly.

## üîÑ Flow

### Main Flow

1. Practitioner sends a request to remove the associated resource via the PatientFlag FHIR API.
2. The API queries the relevant PatientFlag and associated resources.
3. The API deletes the specified associated resource(s).
4. The Practitioner receives an OperationOutcome message confirming the successful deletion of the associated resources.

### Alternate Flow

| Step | Condition                      | Outcome                                               |
|------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 3a   | Associated resource not found  | Return an OperationOutcome indicating resource not found. |

## üîç Querying the API

Use the FHIR Delete API to remove the Patient Flag and its associated resources.

### Example Query

To delete an associated resource (e.g., a Condition resource):

```
DELETE [baseURL]/Condition/[condition-id]?reason=[reason]
```

For example:

```
DELETE [baseURL]/Condition/b8ab463d-f698-41a0-aae2-6d6163dd0825?reason=Outdated
```

This removes the Condition resource with the specified ID and includes a reason for the deletion.

### ‚ö™ No Associated Resources Found

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "information",
      "code": "not-found",
      "diagnostics": "No associated resources found for PatientFlag with id [PatientFlag-id]."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîê Security and Access

- Access to delete resources requires proper authentication and authorization.

- All delete operations are logged for auditing purposes.
