This page shows the functional use cases provided by the Reasonable Adjustments implementation within the PatientFlag API:

- Retrieve a set of top-level Flags (just the Flags with no associated resources)
- Retrieve a specific Reasonable Adjustment Flag with associated resources
- Add a top-level Reasonable Adjustment Flag
- Add a top-level Flag (and associated Adjustment, Impairment or Condition resources)
- Add/remove associated resources (with the dependency that a top-level flag must already be added/removed)
- Remove a top-level Flag (which will remove all associated resources)
