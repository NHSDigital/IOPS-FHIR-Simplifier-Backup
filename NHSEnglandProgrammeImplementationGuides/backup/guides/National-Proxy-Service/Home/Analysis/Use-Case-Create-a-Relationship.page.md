          <li>The clinical professional performs any checks necessary to determine that – to the best of their knowledge – proxy access is safe and appropriate.</li>
          <li>In cases where the patient has capacity or is deemed competent, the clinical professional will seek (and record) consent from the patient.</li>
          <li>The clinical professional will create the relationship, granting proxy access so that the proxy can act on behalf of a patient.</li>
          <li>The clinical professional will set up local permissions for the proxy to access online services within their system and, in the case of granting records access, perform any redactions as necessary.</li>
          <li>The proxy and, where appropriate, the patient get notified about the request being approved, and/or access being granted.</li>
