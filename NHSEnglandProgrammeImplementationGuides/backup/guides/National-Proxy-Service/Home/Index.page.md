## Introduction

Proxy access enables someone to act on behalf of a patient during their health journey. This may involve accessing parts of the patientâ€™s record or performing actions like booking appointments or ordering repeat prescriptions. Currently, proxy access provision is highly inconsistent, with GP practices adopting varied approaches. Some are proactive, while others do not offer proxy access at all. Typically, these processes are manual and burdensome for both users and healthcare professionals.

National Proxy Service aims to solve this problem by providing proxies with a frictionless way to act on behalf of patients they care for across health and care, increasing digital uptake while ensuring they receive a consistent experience of care across all channels.
