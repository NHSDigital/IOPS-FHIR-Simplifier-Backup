## What is the National Proxy Service?

Proxy access is where a person can act for a patient in parts of their health journey, and can involve the proxy accessing parts of a patientâ€™s record, or undertaking actions like appointment booking or ordering repeat prescriptions.  Current proxy access provision is very inconsistent, with GPs running processes of all types. Some GPs are proactive, and some do not offer proxy access at all. The process is usually manual, both for users and professionals.

To address this problem, National Proxy Service intends to provide proxies with a frictionless way to act on behalf of patients they care for across health and care, increasing digital uptake while ensuring they receive a consistent experience of care across all channels.
