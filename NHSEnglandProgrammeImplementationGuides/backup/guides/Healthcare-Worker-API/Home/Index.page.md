## What is Healthcare Worker API?

The internet facing Healthcare worker (HCW) api will enable other systems to look up healthcare worker data. The API aims to allow systems to search, retrieve and display healthcare worker data from +1.4m NHS employees with a healthcare profile.  HCW API's objective is to increase data efficiency, business logic and improve interoperability by enabling systems to access and share information more reliably, flexibly and efficiently while benefiting from improved network and bandwidth capacity, financial savings and easier and smoother access to clinical systems.
