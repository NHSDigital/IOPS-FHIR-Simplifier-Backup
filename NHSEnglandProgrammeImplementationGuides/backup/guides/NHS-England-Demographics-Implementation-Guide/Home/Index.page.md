## Introduction
All patient's journeys start with an awareness of a health complaint e.g. shortness of breath or need of medical treatment e.g. vaccine requirement or trauma

Following this a patient will contact a health or care facility to receive a diagnosis or treatment

In order to proceed with their care all patients will need to be identified on arrival at the facility or when accessing a service

The pathway below provides the proceeding journey
