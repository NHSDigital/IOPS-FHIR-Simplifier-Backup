The Register with a GP surgery service includes a set of mandated questions needed for patient registration with an NHS GP surgery. 

Patients are also asked a series of questions based on their personal circumstances. Where possible the service uses information that the NHS already knows about the patient to reduce the number of questions they have to answer.

The questions asked during the online registration process are all that are needed to successfully progress a patient registration.

It is not possible for a patient to leave mandatory fields unanswered as the service uses data validation. This means that even if a patient's registration contains unanswered questions you should still have all the necessary information you need to progress their registration.  

Here are the 4 categories of questions patients might come across:

1. Mandatory questions - these are essential questions asked to all patients.  

2. Optional health questions - all patients are asked these questions, but they are optional to answer.  

3. Extra questions - some patients may be asked extra questions based on their specific situation.  

4. Customised questions - questions tailored to individual patient needs and circumstances.

More details of the questions asked can be found on the [NHS Digital service pages](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/register-with-a-gp-surgery-service/get-help-using-the-service/questions-asked)
