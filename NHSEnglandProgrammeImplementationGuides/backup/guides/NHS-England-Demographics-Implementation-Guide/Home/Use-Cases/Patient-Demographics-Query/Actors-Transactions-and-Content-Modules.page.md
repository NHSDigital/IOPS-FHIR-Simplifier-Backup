### Use Case



> Mosa is pregnant and visits the local maternity ward for the first time.
>
> The maternity nurse needs to register the patient; in doing so, it is desired to record the patientâ€™s demographic data in the Electronic Patient Record (EPR). The hospital is connected to a NHS England Personnel Demographic Service (PDS). The nurse issues a patient demographic query request to PDS acting as a Patient Identity Source, with some basic patient demographics data as search criteria.
>
> In the returned patient list, she picks an appropriate record for the patient and this is used to create a local patient demographic record in the EPR. Other local systems (Patient Identity Consumer) are informed of this new patient record via Patient Identity Feeds.
>
> Note: PDS may be replaced with a local Patient Administration System (PAS) or regional Master Patient Index (MPI) systems. The use of PDS is often a background interaction.
