## Profile Descriptions
This implementation guide documents the use of FHIR UK Core R4 profiles to support the exchange of pathology laboratory data. Each profile is documented as follows:

### Summary
A brief description of the profile.

### Resource and Profile Links
Links to the base FHIR resource and associated profile(s).

### Profile Views
A formal definition of the profile presented using the following views:

* **Snapshot**: a full definition of the profile
* **Differential**: a description of the differences between the base FHIR resource and the associated profile
* **Hybrid**: a combination of the Snapshot and Differential views; those data elements that have not been changed in the profile (i.e. are the same as the base FHIR resource) are displayed as greyed out text.

### Additional Guidance
Any additional guidance that should be followed when implementing the profile. This may be specific to the Pathology FHIR Implementation Guide, a reference to applicable guidance in the [UK Core Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu2?current) or a combination of the two.

In addition to profile specific guidance, the [UK Core Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu2?current) also includes guidance on more general topics. These are referenced below and should be followed where appropriate:
