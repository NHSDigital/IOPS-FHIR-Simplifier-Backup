                <li>This is an example of a report that contains the results associated with a single test group and a single test.</li>
                <li>The tests were requested as part of the same “event” (i.e. by the same practitioner at the same time for the same subject).</li>
                <li>An instance of <code>ServiceRequest</code> is required for the test group and a separate instance of <code>ServiceRequest</code> is required for the single test.</li>
                <li>Each <code>ServiceRequest</code> within a set of related requests uses a common identifier, <code>ServiceRequest.requisition</code>, to link them together. For further information, refer to the description of the {{pagelink:R4ServiceRequest}} profile.</li>
                <li>In this example, the specimen (venous blood) was collected after the request was made. The specimen is linked to the request within the <code>Bundle</code> using <code>Specimen.request</code>.</li>

            <p>The following is a simplified logical data model that illustrates the key references between the FHIR profiles in the example message bundle. To aid clarity, not all of the references are shown. For a detailed description of the relationships between the FHIR profiles, and how they may be used, refer to {{pagelink:BuildContructPathologyReportBundle}}.</p>
