The following applies to the presentation of any component part of the dosage instruction;

- Always express units of measure using the full description, e.g. `milligram` not `mg`.

- **Important**: The above principal does not apply to units of measure as part of pre-coordinated dm+d concept descriptions, e.g. `Ramipril 5mg capsules`.

- Always express a time-based unit of measure in the plural when applicable, e.g. `2 hour` becomes `2 hours`.

- **Do not** express other units of measure in the plural as this introduces complications with units such as `microgram per millilitre` or `microgram per kilogram per hour`.

- Where multiple statements are allowed, e.g. **when** or **event** structures, then separate each statement with a comma plus whitespace. Replace the last comma separating the final two statements with the word " and ", e.g. `on Monday, Wednesday and Friday`.
