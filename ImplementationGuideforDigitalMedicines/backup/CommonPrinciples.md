The following applies to the presentation of any component part of the dosage instruction;

- In most cases, express numbers as numbers, e.g. `3` not `three`. There are suggested exceptions:
  - Refer to the section below when dealing with `frequency` data for the case of `once` or `twice`.
  - When a proceeding unit of measure starts with a number, e.g. `5ml spoonful` separate the quantity from the unit of measure with a `x` symbol, e.g. `2 x 5ml spoolful`. Alternatively when the quantity is `1` or `2` is may be preferrable to express the quantity in words, e.g. `ONE` or `TWO`, e.g. `TWO 5ml spoonful`. Both options prevent misreading as a `25ml spoonful`.


- Always express units of measure using the full description, e.g. `milligram` not `mg`. An exception is when the unit of measure as part of a pre-coordinated dm+d concept descriptions, e.g. `Ramipril 5mg capsules`.

- Always express a time-based unit of measure in the plural when applicable, e.g. `2 hour` becomes `2 hours`.

- **Do not** express other units of measure in the plural as this introduces complications with units such as `microgram per millilitre` or `microgram per kilogram per hour`.

- Where multiple statements are allowed, e.g. **when** or **event** structures, then separate each statement with a comma plus whitespace. Replace the last comma separating the final two statements with the word " and ", e.g. `on Monday, Wednesday and Friday`.
