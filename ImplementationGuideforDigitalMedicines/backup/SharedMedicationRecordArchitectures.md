    <strong>READER ACTION:</strong> Decide which type of shared record architecture best suits your ecosystem; the combination of care settings, organisations, existing and proposed new clinical systems. Note the suggested maturity roadmap at the bottom of this page.

NHS Regions or local health and care organisations within England are responsible for implementing their own [Integrated Care Systems](https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/what-is-integrated-care/){: .nhsd-a-link }. At the heart of each will be a shared patient record of which medications are key. A view of a patient's current medication is essential information for most patient journeys.

Scotland and Wales are considering more of a national solution for their shared patient records.

There is no single or ideal architecture for a shared medication record, or at least not one that has universal support. This section outlines some architectural options and a suggested maturity roadmap.
