## Element: `authoredOn` <span class="mro-circle mandatory" title="Mandatory"></span>

<div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--bg-light-yellow nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6 nhsd-t-body">
    <strong>Recommendation</strong>: <code>authoredOn</code> should be business required element for most implementations, and to provide a full date-time with timezone - for example: <code>2020-03-26T15:00:00+01:00</code>:
</div>

Recommended that the date and time is the same as recorded and visible within the ePMA system.
