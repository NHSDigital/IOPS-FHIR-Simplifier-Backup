This guidance contains information for the use of medicines-related content within the [UK Core](https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCoreVersionHistory/Home) standard. 

The FHIR standard is used as part of interoperability solutions, sharing medicines data between clinical systems and between integrated and shared record systems across the UK health sector.

## Use Cases

This guidance is applicable for the following use cases. Each is described in more detail within the [Medication Data Use Cases](MedicationsDataUseCases){: .nhsd-a-link } page within the [Design](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreimplementationguideformedicines/Design){: .nhsd-a-link } section.

- Inpatient medication requests, for a named patient, to be dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and intended for administration on a hospital ward.
- Medication requests, for a named patient who is on short-term leave from an inpatient stay (but is not discharged), to be dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and intended for administration at home.
- Discharge medication requests, for a named patient, to be dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and issued on discharge for administration at home.
- Outpatient medication requests, for a named patient, to be dispensed by the hospital pharmacy and intended for administration in the Outpatients department, Accident and Emergency department, or Day unit.
- Outpatient medication requests, for a named patient, to be dispensed by the hospital pharmacy for administration at home.
- Medicines reconciliation on hospital admission and discharge, obtaining and updating current medication with a shared medication record system.
- Internal hospital transfer (to a ward using a different ePMA system).
- Hospital transfer to another hospital (using a different ePMA system).

Which can all be supported by the implementation of [Shared Medication Records](SharedMedicationRecordArchitectures).
