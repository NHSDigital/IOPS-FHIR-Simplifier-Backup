To illustrate how the FHIR `Dosage` structure should be used using 12 clinically verified examples where most data is fully coded data but important instructions cannot be coded so have to be conveyed using the free-text elements within the `Dosage` structure. These examples therefore cannot be fully machine readable and would require human interpretation to ensure the free-text instructions are adhered to, and that they do not contradict the coded instructions.

    <strong>Note:</strong> All <code>dosageInstruction.text</code> element values have been constructed using the <a href='DosetoTextTranslation'>dose to text translation algorithm</a> from within this guide.
