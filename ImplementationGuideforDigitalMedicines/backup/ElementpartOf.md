## Element: `partOf` <span class="mro-circle optional" title="Optional"></span>

<div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--bg-light-yellow nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6 nhsd-t-body">
    It is recommended this element is optional for an MVP implementation.
</div>

This element could be useful in two scenarios:

- sending a bag of medicines to a ward for discharge, as this could indicate whether there is `partOf` the order elsewhere
- could also be used to interpret as 'owings' in the event of a partial supply being dispensed
