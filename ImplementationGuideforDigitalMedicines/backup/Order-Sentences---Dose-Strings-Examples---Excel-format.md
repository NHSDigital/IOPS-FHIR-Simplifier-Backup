These examples are primary care dose strings and secondary care order sentences. They have been created to cover a range of examples that organisations can use as part of their internal assurance processes when implementing FHIR dose syntax. These order sentences have not been clinically assured and are for use in a test environment only.  It is incumbent on the organisation to use their own tailored data to use in testing to reflect their own clinical requirements and implementation at a local level. The examples are used to simulate the MedicationRequest standard.
