## Element: `identifier` <span class="mro-circle mandatory" title="Mandatory"></span>

This **MUST** be populated with a globally unique and persistent identifier (that is, it doesnâ€™t change between requests and therefore stored with the source data). This **MUST** be scoped by a provider specific namespace for the identifier.

Where consuming systems are integrating data from this resource to their local system, they **MUST** also persist this identifier at the same time.
