An API client allows a user to connect to an API and provide it with additional details that may not be able to be provided from a web browser. There are a variety of different API clients available - an example few below:

1. [Nightingale](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/nightingale-rest-client/9n2t6f9f5zdn#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
2. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
3. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

It doesn't matter which one you decide to install. They will all work with the assurance tool.
