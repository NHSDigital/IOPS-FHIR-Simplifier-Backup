**Note:** It is acknowledged that a typical Hospital Patient Administration System (PAS) available today will not expose a FHIR interface so referencing by URL will most likely not be available for some time; however, this should be a _target architecture_ so that the FHIR-enabled PAS can be used as a trusted source of Patient resources across multiple hospital systems.

See population of a [Patient](Patient) resource.
