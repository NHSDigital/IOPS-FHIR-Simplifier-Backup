To illustrate how the FHIR `Dosage` structure should be used using 29 clinically verified examples using fully coded data. Where appropriate, examples have been modelled as both **product-based** and **dose-based** instructions. All examples are based on the `MedicationRequest` resource but equally could apply to `MedicationDispense` and `MedicationStatement`.
