The versioning approach to the NHSE Implementation Guide releases are based on the FHIR Standard and is summarised below.

There are three numbers used with the versioning in the format n.n.n for example 0.3.0. The following rules apply:

- The first number is the major version starts at 1
- The second number is incremented for every development release
- The third number can also be incremented for patch a development

The version number will formally be agreed for each release by the NHSE Development Team.

### The Release Sequence
The NHSE IG uses similar release sequences as the FHIR standard, these are:

- Pre-release – for reviews only
- Standard for Trial Use (STU) - releases
- Normative – may never be used

### Standard for Trial Use (STU)
This is the sequence used for the NHS England release. This version of the release is relatively stable because it has been though the [Clinical and Technical Assurance](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSE-Design-and-Development-Approach2/Home/Assurance---Endorsement/Clinical-and-Technical-Assurance.page.md?version=current "Title") process and all known/raised issues resolved and agreed. There will be a number of releases of the STU sequence which will be denoted by the number STU1, STU2, STU3 etc...

### Normative
This is the final status of the NHSE IG release that has been proven by multiple implementations of the NHSE IG. This is currently under review as to whether this status is ever used.

### Releases

Each of the sequences will have a major release number to indicate the release within the sequence for example:-

- STU1 indicates it is the first release in the sequence STU (Standard for Trial Use)
- STU2 indicates it is the second release in the sequence STU (Standard for Trial Use)

The release aligns with the HL7 UK Ballot process, and the major version number of the Implementation Guide reflects this. There is only one major release per sequence. There will be multiple minor releases and maybe some patch releases.
