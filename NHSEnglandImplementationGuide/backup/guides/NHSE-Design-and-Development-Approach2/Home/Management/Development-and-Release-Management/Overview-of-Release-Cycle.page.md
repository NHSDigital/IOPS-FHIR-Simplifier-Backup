The section details the NHS England IG release cycle and how the various versions are defined.

### Overview Of Cycle

The diagram below illustrates how the NHS England IG Release cycle works and is an abstract view of the way it is released. This is an evolving process, and the diagram only shows one release cycle of a sequence of a repeating process.

1. A Use Case or Simplifier Issue is usually the starting point for a release. A Use Case will come from an NHS England stakeholder, a project or programme of work.

2. The IOPS development team will analyse the requirements and develop draft FHIR Assets.

3. NHS England Stakeholders will then be involved during C&TA to discuss the Use Case, issues and proposed solutions. Any rework required is completed.

4. The NHS England IG is released on the next version.
