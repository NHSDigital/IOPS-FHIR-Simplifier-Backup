## {{page-title}}

Simplifier holds all <a href="https://simplifier.net/NHS-England-Implementation-Guide/~introduction" target="_blank">HL7 FHIR® NHS England R4</a> project source files, with the Implementation Guide (IG) being a human readable html view of the project. 
Feedback and review comments must be submitted as a Simplifier issue. Issues should be logged at the level of the FHIR Simplifier resource.

It is acknowledged that not everyone will have enough knowledge of FHIR Implementation Guides or Simplifier to log an issue to the correct Simplifier resource (see note below) and therefore logging at the project level is allowable if this is the case. 

**Note: Simplifier refers to everything as a resource whether it’s an image, example or FHIR profile**

All issues will be processed internally by the IOPS team, prioritised accordingly and may be escalated to the UK FHIR board if needed. Major updates to the issue will be communicated via the Simpifier issue ticket.

## Requesting a new NHS England Asset

## Instructions for raising an Issue within Simplifier
Requests and Feedback should be logged within Simplifier. The steps below higlighted the processes required to log a request or raise issues.

### Creating a Simplifier Account
Although the NHS England FHIR Assets project is in the public domain, you will need to <a href='https://simplifier.net/signup' target="_blank"> create an account</a> to raise issues. A username, email address and a chosen password are the only details needed to set up an account.

### Navigation to the NHS England FHIR Assets Project
The FHIR Assets are stored within the <a href='https://simplifier.net/NHS-England-Implementation-Guide/~introduction' target="_blank"> HL7 FHIR® NHS England R4 </a> project in Simplifier.

When the change request is for a change to an existing NHS England FHIR asset, the preferred approach is to raise the issue at the level of the relevant asset.

### Create a Simplifier issue at NHS England Asset level
Issue logging at asset level is the preferred approach, as it makes triage of issues easier. A <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Tefmbxj-nXickLin4VCpIsTFUDJM8rv/view?usp=sharing' target="_blank">'Feedback' tab</a> is provided on each of the FHIR Assets page, navigate to the Feedback tab to expose the web link to the asset level issues log page.


Create a new issue and give as much detail as neccessary to help understand the problem. Email notifications will be created upon any status changes and replies to the issue.

If it is not appropriate to log an issue at the Simplifier resource level, then you should raise an issue at the project level. In this case, the title and/or issue text should identify which part of the NHS England FHIR Assets Project is the subject of the issue being raised.

### Creating a Simplifier Issue at Project Level
To create a issue at the project level,<a href='https://simplifier.net/NHS-England-Implementation-Guide/~issues' target="_blank"> navigate to the project.</a> Once you are in the project, click on the "Issues" tab and then the "Create issue" button to create a new issue.
