### NHS England Validation
The NHS England Implementation Guide and FHIR Assets are validated for quality purposes during develpoment in several ways:
- The GitHub repo has HAPI based code to validate the FHIR assets are valid against the FHIR R4 standard and UK Core.
- The Simplifier development platform has built in validation of content on loading and creation.


### Derived Implementation Validation
Implementers SHALL validate their implementations against the NHS England Package using a HAPI based validator if they are claiming conformance to the NHS England Implementation Guide. There is no current approved validator, but work is ongoing to clarify guidance on how validation should be done.
