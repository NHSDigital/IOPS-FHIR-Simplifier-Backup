- External links to HL7 FHIR SHALL be the same version as NHS England IG. 
- Each header SHALL be in Title case unless the header wording is an element, then is SHALL be in camelCase and as an inline code. 
- Elements and values SHALL be written as an inline code. 
- The first index title will be in the markdown form as \# Header1. 
- Each following page first title shall be in the from \## Header2. 
- Sub headers within these pages SHALL be in the form \### Header3 or \#### Header4 where needed

## Information Boxes 

There are two information boxes in use in the IG, a blue box and a yellow box. 

Blue should be used for additional callouts of information, e.g.:
~~~~html
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i> <code>England-Patient</code> was added after specific review and feedback from the Digital and Interoperable Medicines Programme. It was not added under a Clinical & Technical Assurance sprint
</div>
~~~~
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i> <code>England-Patient</code> was added after specific review and feedback from the Digital and Interoperable Medicines Programme. It was not added under a Clinical & Technical Assurance sprint
</div>

Yellow should be used for important information, e.g.:
~~~~html
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Important</h4>
Where the prescription is available, it is recommended to reference via a URL - using the <code>Patient.managingOrganization.identifier</code> element rather than adding the <code>Patient</code> as a bundle - to avoid duplication.
</div>

## Balloted Information

Where guidance has been added or changed between ballots, it SHALL be highlighted in green.

For tr, td, li elements, this is done by adding <code>class="balloted"</code>

For Extensions, Profiles, ValueSets, CodeSystems that have been ADDED, this is done by adding this to the top of the relevant page - this will turn the whole of that Extension, ValueSet, CodeSystem green, or if added to a Profile page, the whole page green.

~~~~html
<div id="newAsset" markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Important</h4>

This [Asset Type] underwent Clinical and Technical Assurance during Sprint X. This is a new [Asset Type] added to NHS England IG, and should undergo review under Ballot Y.
</div>
~~~~

The same div, without the <code>id="newAsset"</code> can be used on a page to add a green banner to the page. This should be used on any guidance page that is not an asset, e.g. within CodeableConcept guidance.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Important</h4>

This [Asset Type] underwent Clinical and Technical Assurance during Sprint X. This is a new [Asset Type] added to NHS England IG, and should undergo review under Ballot Y.
</div>

## Rendering Additional Content

Where guidance has been added in another IG, such as the glossary, this can be rendered in an IG using the Simpifier { {render: command }}, which can work across projects and organisations.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<h4><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Important</h4>
Currently, Simplifier commands, such as FQL or pagelink / tree / xml / json / render, will not be processed by the rendered page.
</div>
