Where they don't already exist, the NHS England approach to creating codes for concepts in a new CodeSystem is by placing a hyphen between each word of the display value (if they contain more than one word) and using solely lower case alphabetic characters.

An exception to this is where the CodeSystem is a copy of an English Data Dictionary set of concepts, where the approach is to faithfully use both the code and its description within the CodeSystem as defined within the Data Dictionary source at the time of creation of the CodeSystem. Note that for some CodeSystems already in existence in the NHS England IG, including content previously created for other projects, alternative code construction forms have also been used.
