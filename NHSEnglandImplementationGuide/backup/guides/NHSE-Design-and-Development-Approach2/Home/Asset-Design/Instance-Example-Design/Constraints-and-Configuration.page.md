Instance examples in Simplifier need to be correctly named and constructed to avoid duplicates being generated or other conflicts occurring. This guidance overrides the default Simplifier behaviour and has been developed following consultation with the Simplifier development team.

When creating examples the filename SHALL adhere to the following convention:

- **ProfileExampleName** - <samp>England-[ProfileName]-[FurtherDescription]-Example</samp>

The value of [FurtherDescription] SHALL be enough information for a user to understand what the example is representing. This description SHALL also be sufficient to make the example unique in the NHS England IG.
