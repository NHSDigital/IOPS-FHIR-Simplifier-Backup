This section is about engagement with stakeholders. The NHS England IG has many stakeholders with very differing knowledge levels and interests. These stakeholders will be anyone from NHS England involved in interoperability using FHIR. 

Stakeholders are often the requestors/sponsors of projects or programmes that require FHIR assets to be created or amended.

However, stakeholders can also be users/implementors of the NHS England IG and may notice an issue and raise this against the IG via Simplifier.

The Clinical and Technical Assurance process details how stakeholders are engaged as part of assuring the NHS England IG.

The pages in this section contain information about how the NHS England IG development team has engaged with the NHS England programs via presentations and information sharing sessions.

## Awareness and Learning

This section gives access to material that has been previously shared with the FHIR Community for the purpose of engagement.
