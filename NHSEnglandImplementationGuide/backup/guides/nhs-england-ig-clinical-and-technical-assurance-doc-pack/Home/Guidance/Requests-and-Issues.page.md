This page gives guidance about what is asked of a participant in the C&TA process. The documented information falls into three main types:

1. Information to help or guide participants in the C&TA process.
1. Reference information which gives further context, etc. to the information that needs to be reviewed. The referenced material is not part of the C&TA process.
1. Information which is contained in the NHS England Implementation Guide STU1 guide. This is the source material which needs to be reviewed by participants in the C&TA process.

Although not part of the C&TA process, feedback is welcome on items 1 and 2 to help improve the documentation and C&TA process. This feedback will be fed into a post C&TA retrospective which will be open to all participants.

Requests and Feedback should be logged within Simplifier.
