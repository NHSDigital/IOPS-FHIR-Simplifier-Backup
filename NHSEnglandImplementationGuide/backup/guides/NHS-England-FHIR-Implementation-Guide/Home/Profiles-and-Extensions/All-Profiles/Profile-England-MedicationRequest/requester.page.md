## `requester`

<b>Definition</b><br>

The requester must contain a resource reference to the Practitioner who has electronically signed the prescription. 

If the `requester` can not take responsibility for the prescription, i.e. they would not be the prescriber on the FP10. Then the **extension responsiblePractitioner** must be populated.
