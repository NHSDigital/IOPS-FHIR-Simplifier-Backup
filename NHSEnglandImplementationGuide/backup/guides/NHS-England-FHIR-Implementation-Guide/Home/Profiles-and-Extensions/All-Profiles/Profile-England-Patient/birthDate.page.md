## `birthDate`

<b>Definition:</b>

The date on which the patient was born or is officially deemed to have been born.

It is a date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. Due to data quality issues on a small number of patients `yyyy-mm` and `yyyy` format may also be returned.

When a patient tagged as `very restricted` is retrieved, birth date is removed from the response.
