## `gender`

<b>Definition:</b>

Classification of the gender of a patient. The classification is phenotypical rather than genotypical, i.e. it does not provide codes for medical or scientific purposes. It is the administrative gender that the patient wishes to be known as. In some cases, this may not be the same as the patientâ€™s registered birth gender, or their current clinical gender.
