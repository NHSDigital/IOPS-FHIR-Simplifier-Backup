## `restriction.period.end`

<b>Definition</b><br>

In **e-RS** this is also known as the review date due.

- If deferred to provider (because there were no appointments available for a directly bookable service) then this is the date by which the provider should resolve the appointment slot issue; or
- If the referral was sent to a triage service then this is the date by which the provider should have reviewed the referral.
