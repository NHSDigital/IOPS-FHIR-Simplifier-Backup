## `organization`

<b>Definition:</b>

This **MUST** either be a reference to a Organization resource or an identifier reference. In both cases the reference must contain an ANANA/ODS organisation code.

#### organisation resource references

It is recommended an *identifier reference* is included.

Optionally *Resource reference* can be provided. This is required in the current version of EPS but this will be changed to supporting the *identifier reference* only.
