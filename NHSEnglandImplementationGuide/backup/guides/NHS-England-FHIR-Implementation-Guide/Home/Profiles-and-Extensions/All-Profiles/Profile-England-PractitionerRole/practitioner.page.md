## `practitioner`

<b>Definition:</b>

This **MUST** either be a reference to a Practitioner resource or an identifier reference plus a display. In both cases the referenced resource or identfier reference should contain a professional code.

It is recommended an *identifier reference* and *display* (practioner full name) is included. This identifier should be the Practitioner's primary professional code (see `England-Practitioner` for details on professional codes).

For EPS, currently a *Resource reference* is required.
