This page is required (mandatory if clinical headings are used by the specification).

The clinical headings are created by bodies such as the PRSB and are used to add structure to the FHIR instance. 

Sub-pages are required in most cases (one for each heading).

The page requires guidance about the heading and the structure required (which should be represented as a diagram).
