## Interoperability
	
Interoperability is the capacity for each system on a network to communicate with other systems to share, consolidate, and use data. Interoperable applications and systems automatically exchange data in such a way that the data is accessible, accurate, and secure, with little human interaction needed. Interoperability is possible only when all stakeholders—healthcare organizations, governments, payers, and other players—agree on the standards, technologies, and terminology needed for the exchange of data between diverse systems.

## Healthcare Interoperability ##

Interoperability in healthcare describes the capacity for disparate health data systems to share data, regardless of geographic location, and allow that data to be used by providers, researchers, and public health managers to improve patient experiences and community health. Interoperable health systems have their own set of standards and guidelines, with the goal of creating a network of shared health data so that providers can access complete, accurate patient data no matter where the patient has previously received care.

## About FHIR

The HL7® FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources 1 ) standard defines how healthcare information can be exchanged between different computer systems regardless of how it is stored in those systems. It allows healthcare information, including clinical and administrative data, to be available securely to those who have a need to access it, and to those who have the right to do so for the benefit of a patient receiving care. The standards development organization HL7® (Health Level Seven®3) uses a
collaborative approach to develop and upgrade FHIR.

FHIR’s development began in 2012 in response to market needs for faster, easier, and better methods to exchange the rapidly growing amount health data. This growth in the availability of new health data, along
with the progressing “app” economy, created the need for clinicians and consumers to be able to share data in a lightweight, real-time fashion using modern internet technologies and standards.

FHIR is based on internet standards widely used by industries outside of healthcare. In particular, these include the REST approach, which describes how individual packets of information (termed Resources) can be shared easily. By adopting existing standards and technologies already familiar to software developers, FHIR significantly lowers the barriers of entry for new software developers to support healthcare needs.
