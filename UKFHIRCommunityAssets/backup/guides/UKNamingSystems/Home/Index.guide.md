### What is a NamingSystem?
A FHIR NamingSystem is a URL that acts as a well known "name" for the type of another concept, such as an NHS Number (an identifier) or a SNOMED CT code (codesystem). 

The name is a machine readable unique string for the scheme of an identifier or codesystem. When a concept is used in FHIR, such as an identifier in a Patient resource, there needs to be a way to show that it is from the set of NHS Numbers and not some other type of identifier. This concept type is a URL, that acts as a name, and it is used in `identifier.system` or `coding.system`. FHIR NamingSystem URLs are equivalent to OIDs used in earlier versions of HL7. OIDs can still be used but are deprecated for use in FHIR.

 This guide is a catalogue of the UK naming URLs. Each name entry is held in a FHIR NamingSystem resource.These resources are only needed as documentation within this catalogue. It is only the naming URL itself that is used in actual FHIR data. Software systems only need to use the correct URL, and donâ€™t need to directly deal with the NamingSystem resources.
