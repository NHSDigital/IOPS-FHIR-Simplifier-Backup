## Overview

The Personal Demographics Service (PDS) helps healthcare professionals to identify patients and match them to their health records. It also allows them to contact and communicate with patients.

The PDS FHIR API allows you to access the Personal Demographics Service - the national electronic database of NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth and NHS Number.
