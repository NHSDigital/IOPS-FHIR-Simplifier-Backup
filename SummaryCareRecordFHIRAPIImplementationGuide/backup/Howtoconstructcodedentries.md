### How to construct coded entries

Each SNOMED CT concept used in a Summary Care Record has an assocaited Care Record Element Type (CRE Type). Each CRE Type is represented by a FHIR resource type in the FHIR Summary Care Record document. For the mapping of CRE Types to resource types see {{pagelink:codedentriescovid-19}}

The following lists examples of coded entries for each CRE Type within the set of COVID-19 SNOMED CT concepts that should be part of the Summary Care Record. Note that some CRE Types are not supported by SCR, and these use the "default" Clinical Observations and Findings heading.
