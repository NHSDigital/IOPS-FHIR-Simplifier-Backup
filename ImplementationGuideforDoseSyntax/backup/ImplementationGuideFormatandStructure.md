## Implementation Guide Format and Structure

The table below gives the reader of this implementation guide guidance about the structure of the guide and an indication of the purpose and intended audience of the sections and pages the guide contains. The intended audience is included to illustrate which type of reader the page is primarily aimed at and of course does not exclude other types of readers from reviewing and feeding back to the team producing the implementation guide.

**Note**: not all pages described in the table will be present in every implementation guide as the content is dependent on things such as:

- How the information is exchanged (which FHIR Paradigm used RESTful, Messaging, Document etc.)
- Whether Clinical headings are used in the exchange of the information
- Which FHIR assets are used in the information exchange
- The type of information that is being exchanged
