### SNOMED

In the instance where a UCUM unit of measure is not defined, use a [SNOMED-CT](https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_elements/unit_of_measurement__snomed_ct_dm_d_.html) unit of measure instead. All units of measure are descendants of concept [`767524001 | Unit of measure (qualifier value)`](https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&conceptId1=767524001&edition=uk-edition,999000691000001104) which includes both UCUM and non-UCUM codes.

Concept [`732935002 | Unit of presentation (unit of presentation)`](https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&conceptId1=732935002&edition=uk-edition), which is also a descendant of the Unit of measure concept, holds a list non-UCUM units of measure that are used within prescribing:

Examples of where a SNOMED-CT unit of measure would typically be used are:

- tablet
- capsule
- ampoule
