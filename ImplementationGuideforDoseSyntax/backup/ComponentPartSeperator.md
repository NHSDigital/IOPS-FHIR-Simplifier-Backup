## Component Part Separator

In most cases, each component part of the medication instruction is separated by space-dash-space, e.g. " - ".

- Oxytetracycline 250mg tablets `-` 1 tablet `-` 4 times a day `-` oral

- Oxytetracycline `-` 250 milligram `-` 4 times a day `-` oral

**Exceptions are as follows:**

- Use a single whitespace after a `method`, e.g. _Apply..._

- Use a single whitespace to separate between a `dayOfWeek` and `timeOfDay`, e.g. _on Monday at 10:30_
