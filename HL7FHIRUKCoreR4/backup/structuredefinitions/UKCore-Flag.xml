  <description value="This profile defines the UK constraints and extensions on the International FHIR resource [Flag](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/Flag.html)." />
  <purpose value="A flag is a warning or notification of some sort presented to the user - who may be a clinician or some other person involve in patient care. It usually represents something of sufficient significance to warrant a special display of some sort - rather than just a note in the resource. A flag has a subject representing the resource that will trigger its display.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This subject can be of different types, as described in the examples below:   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- A note that a patient has an overdue account, which the provider may wish to discuss with them - in case of hardship, for example (`subject = Patient`)   &#xD;&#xA;- An outbreak of Ebola in a particular region (`subject = Location`) so that all patients from that region have a higher risk of having that condition   &#xD;&#xA;- A particular provider is unavailable for referrals over a given period (`subject = Practitioner`)   &#xD;&#xA;- A patient who is enrolled in a clinical trial (`subject = Group`)   &#xD;&#xA;- Special guidance or caveats to be aware of when following a protocol (`subject = PlanDefinition`)   &#xD;&#xA;- Warnings about using a drug in a formulary requires special approval (`subject = Medication`)" />
