## `status` (Mandatory)

**MUST** be populated with a fixed valueset defined within the FHIR standard.

**It is expected that most implementations will require the use of status to support workflow.**

The status can be used to determine the overall status of medication administration events.

It is recommended that the `status` is used to indicate the status at a high-level so that integrated systems can determine how to represent this information.

                The authoring system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this request. Note: This concept is not to be used for 'other' - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, it's just not known which one.

                The patient may have had some encounter with this medication, but the current status is unknown. Avoid the use of this status value where possible.
