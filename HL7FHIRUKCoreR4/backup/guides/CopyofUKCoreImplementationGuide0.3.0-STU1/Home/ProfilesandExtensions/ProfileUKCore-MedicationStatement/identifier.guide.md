## `identifier`
This should be populated with a globally unique and persistent identifier (that is, it doesnâ€™t change between requests and therefore stored with the source data). This should be scoped by a provider specific namespace for the identifier.

Where consuming systems are integrating data from this resource to their local system, they should persist this identifier at the same time.
