## `identifier`
A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.

### `identifier.system`

A URI for the system that has allocated the vaccination identifier.
Note, this must be unique within a given Supplier system or instance of Supplier system.

e.g. 
1) Example of a “single instance for all customers” Supplier system
`https://supplierABC/identifiers/vacc`.

2) Example of “per customer instance” Supplier system
`https://supplierABC/ODSCode/NKO41/identifiers/vacc`.


### `identifier.value`

A unique identifier for the vaccination record, that is consistent between any subsequent update or delete records.

Ideally this would be a GUID / UUID.

Value in combination with UNIQUE_ID_URI must be globally unique.
In other words, a combination of `identifier.value` and `identifier.system` act as composite primary key to allow lookup of any Adverse Reactions records from the corresponding Adverse Reaction data file.

1) UUID example:
`e045626e-4dc5-4df3-bc35-da25263f901e`

2) Example of a “single instance for all customers” Supplier system
`ACME-vacc123456`.

3) Example of “per customer instance” Supplier system
`ACME-CUSTOMER1-vacc123456`
`ACME-CUSTOMER2-vacc123456`.
