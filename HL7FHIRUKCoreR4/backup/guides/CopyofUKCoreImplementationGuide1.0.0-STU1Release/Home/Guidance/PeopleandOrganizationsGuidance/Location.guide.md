## `Location`

This profile describes locations at which health and care is delivered. It can represent anything from a bed to a multi-building site. A location can be a `partOf` another location and can be linked to a `managingOrganization`.

A location can represent an actual physical location or a class(type) of location see {{pagelink:Profile-Location-mode-f6ddb6dd-d86c-46bd-8743-cfc70cd33545}} for futher infomation.

Be careful not confuse location with organisation. Use location to specify a physical location or class of locations. Use organisation to specify the legally responsible organisation.
