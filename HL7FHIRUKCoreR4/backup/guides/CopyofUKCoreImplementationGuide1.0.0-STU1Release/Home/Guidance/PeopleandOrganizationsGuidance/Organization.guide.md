## `Organization`

This profile describes organisations involved in the delivery of health and care.

An organisation is the legal entity responsible for the care of a patient, for example a NHS Trust or GP Practice.

Organisations (including private and third sector organisations working with the NHS) should have an ODS organisation code.

Be careful not confuse organisation with location. Use organisation to specify the legally responsible organisation. Use location to specify a physical location or class of locations.

Guidance relating to organisations  may be found on the {{pagelink:ProfileUKCore-Organization-Index-110}} page.
