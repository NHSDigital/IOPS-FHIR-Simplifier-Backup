## `PractitionerRole`

This profile relates to the role(s) of a practitioner and can also specify the organizations and/or locations at which the practitioner performs particular roles.
 
This profile can only specify one organisation. Where a practitioner works in multiple organizations an instance of this Profile should be created for each organisation.
 
Multiple locations within an organisation can be linked to this profile. However, when the role(s) performed at different locations are different an instance of the Profile should be created for each different set of location(s)/role(s).

Guidance relating to Roles of practitioners may be found on the {{pagelink:Profile-Organization-3826477b-c49f-45cd-a6a4-a179826dd3a8}} page.
