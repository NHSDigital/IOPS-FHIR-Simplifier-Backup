<b>Detail:</b>

<ul>
<li>The Extension UK Core Clinical Setting will be removed from the UK Core as it effectively duplicates Extension UK Core Care Setting Type.</li>
<li>The Extension UK Core Care Setting Type will be bound to the List profile instead of Extension UK Core Clinical Setting.</li>
<li>The description of Extension UK Core Care Setting Type will be modified to make it more generic and not specific to Composition.</li>
</ul>
