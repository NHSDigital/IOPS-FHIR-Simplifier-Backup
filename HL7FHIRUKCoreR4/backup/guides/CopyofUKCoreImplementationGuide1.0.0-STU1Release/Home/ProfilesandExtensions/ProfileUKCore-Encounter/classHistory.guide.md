The class history permits the tracking of the encounters transitions without needing to go through the resource history. This would be used for a case where an admission starts of as an emergency encounter, then transitions into an inpatient scenario. Doing this and not restarting a new encounter ensures that any lab/diagnostic results can more easily follow the patient and not require re-processing and not get lost or cancelled during a kind of discharge from emergency to inpatient.
