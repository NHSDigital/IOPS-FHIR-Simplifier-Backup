## `basedOn`

Optional.

A reference to any number of `CarePlan`, `MedicationRequest`, `ServiceRequest` or `ReferralRequest` resources.

**Recommendation**: To reference a previous medication request use `priorPrescription` instead of this element.

If the clinical system has implemented the `CarePlan` resource, a logical link to the care plan for which the medication request is based has business benefit.
