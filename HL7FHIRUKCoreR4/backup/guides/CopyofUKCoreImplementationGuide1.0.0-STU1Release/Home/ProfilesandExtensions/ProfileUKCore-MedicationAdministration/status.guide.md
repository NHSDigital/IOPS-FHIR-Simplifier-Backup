## `status` (Mandatory)

**MUST** be populated with a fixed valueset defined within the FHIR standard.

**It is expected that most implementations will require the use of status to support workflow.**

The status can be used to determine the overall status of medication administration events.

It is recommended that the `status` is used to indicate the status at a high-level so that integrated systems can determine how to represent this information.

                The authoring system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this request. Note: This concept is not to be used for 'other' - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, it's just not known which one.
            </td>
            <td>
                The patient may have had some encounter with this medication, but the current status is unknown. Avoid the use of this status value where possible.

Comments from the Meds Interop Working Group (20-Sept-21).
Why is "planned' not in this value set?
Resolution = Not required as MedsAdmin is always a retrospective view, i.e. what has happened, not what is going to happen.

Tony Dilks: HL7 people have said it’s for recording events that have happened in the past, not the future, hence no need for ‘planned’.

Need to add a paragraph reinforcing the above.

- The status will record events that have occured/happened in the past, not the future. 

- The status will record events that have occured/happened in the past, and so does not account for future changes.

- The status is retrospective, so the events represented by the status will have occured/happened in the past. 

- The status is retrospective and is not concerned by potential or future changes to events.
