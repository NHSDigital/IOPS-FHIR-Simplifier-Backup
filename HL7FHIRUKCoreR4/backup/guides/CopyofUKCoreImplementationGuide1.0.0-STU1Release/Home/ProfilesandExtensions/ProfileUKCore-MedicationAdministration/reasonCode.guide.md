Comments from the Meds Interop Working Group (20-Sept-21).
This could be useful to record why an administration was given early/late.

We need to be able to both record it was ‘as ordered’ or ‘emergency’, AND to be able to record why given early / late. Can this all use this element? In theory yes as multiple codes can be recorded. Or is some of this better a freetext within the Note element?

Ewan: In the example value set, the term ‘emergency’ could be misleading.
