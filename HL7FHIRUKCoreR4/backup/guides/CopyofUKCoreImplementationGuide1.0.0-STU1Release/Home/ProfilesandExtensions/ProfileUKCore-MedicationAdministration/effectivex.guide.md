## `effective[x]` (Mandatory)

A mandatory dateTime or period for the administration.

<!--

Comments from the Meds Interop Working Group (20-Sept-21).
Most of the time a DateTime is sensible.
Some cases may benefit from using the Period, but often things are not administered to exact timescales.

For accuracy, use effectivePeriod to record the actual administration period for continuous adminstrations; infusions, patches etc.
