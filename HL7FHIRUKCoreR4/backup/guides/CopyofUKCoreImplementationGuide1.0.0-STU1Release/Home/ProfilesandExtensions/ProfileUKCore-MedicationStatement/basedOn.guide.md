## `basedOn`

This element should normally be used to link to a `MedicationRequest` which authorised the medication.

This element could potentially reference all medication requests relating to the medication or relevant instances of `CarePlan` or `ServiceRequest`.

This should not be confused with `MedicationStatement.derivedFrom` which should only be used to reference information that canâ€™t be referenced here.
