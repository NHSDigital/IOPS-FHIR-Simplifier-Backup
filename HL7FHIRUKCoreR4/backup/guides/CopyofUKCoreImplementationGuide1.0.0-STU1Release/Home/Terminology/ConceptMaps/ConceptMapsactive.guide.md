## ConceptMaps(active)

The UK Core does not currently define any active  ConceptMaps because none have currently been identified as usable across the whole of the UK. Where there is a need for a ConceptMap these should be done as part of a derived Implementation Guide. For Example NHS Digital could define ConceptMaps for Spine APIs to UK Core terminology resources.
