# About this guide

This guide provides guidance for implementers for an example set of use cases. These example use cases will not be the only use cases that the FHIR UK Core is suitable for, as there will many local uses of the UK Core. The development team would welcome any suitable use cases for inclusion in this guide.

The use cases have the source of the use case to identify where the use orginated from and where possible contact details for the source. The guidance should be in enough detail to allow implementers to build the functionally provided by the use case into their system. This guidance may also link off to guidance provided by other organisations or standard bodies if applicable.
