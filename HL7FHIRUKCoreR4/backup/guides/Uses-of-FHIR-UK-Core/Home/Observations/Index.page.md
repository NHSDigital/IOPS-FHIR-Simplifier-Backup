The following derived vital signs are part of the <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/ClinicalObservations/VitalSignsObservation?version=current">NHS England Clinical Observations IG</a>:

- Oxygen Saturation 
- Heart Rate
- Respiration Rate
- Blood Pressure
- Temperature
- Height / Length
- Head Circumference 
- Weight
- Body Mass Index (BMI)

along derived survey based vital signs, that is any vital sign recorded by the health care worker using an assessment scale or survey tool:

- Baseline Oxygen Saturation
- Baseline Systolic
- Baseline Diastolic
- Target Oxygen Saturation
- Consciousness
- Respiration Distress
- Air or Oxygen
- Capiliary Refill Time
- Patient Concern
- Birth Weight
- Gestational Age at Birth
- NCMP Withdrawal Reason

and the with the derived score observations:

- Baseline NEWS2 Score
- Baseline NPEWS1 Score
- Score Chart Used
- Respiration Rate Score
- Respiration Distress Score
- Oxygen Saturation Score
- Air or Oxygen Score
- Systolic Score
- Pulse Rate Score
- Capiliary Refill Time Score
- Consciousness Score
- Temperature Score

It is our intent to create these within the UK Core IG so that they are standardised thoughout the UK.

These will be derived from the UK Core Observation VitalSigns profile and should align with the derived profiles from the base HL7 and IPS where practicable. Any relevant profiles merged where possible, for instance the Oxygen Saturation vital signs and the Oxygen Saturation survey vital signs.

## Profiles to be put forward for Sprint 7
