**Purpose:** 
This use case is from the C&TA sprints where a number of FHIR resource types were identified as fundamental to most FHIR implementations and therefore would need to be available in the UK Core in the early development versions. These resource types will be utilised in other UK Core use cases but this generic use case is about query, retrieve and exchange of data using these resource types. The resource types may be used alone or in a combination such as a retrieval of a list of patient encounters. This use case is broken down into a number of sub use cases.
