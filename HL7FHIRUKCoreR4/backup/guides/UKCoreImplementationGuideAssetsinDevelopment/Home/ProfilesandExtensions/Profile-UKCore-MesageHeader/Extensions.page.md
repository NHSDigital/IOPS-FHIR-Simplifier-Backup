<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Important note regarding the extension <code>messageheader-response-request</code> in the {{pagelink:Library-Extensions-HL7}}. </h4>This extension is defined as having a root conformance of 1..1 which mandates the use of the extension if added to any profile. This is an error and has been amended in R5 but will not be updated in R4. Therefore this extension is not hardcoded in the profile as this is not the desired behaviour.
