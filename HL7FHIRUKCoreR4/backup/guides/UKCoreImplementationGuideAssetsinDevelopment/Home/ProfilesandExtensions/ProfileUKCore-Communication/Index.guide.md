## StructureDefinition-UKCore-Communication

Defines the UK Core constraints and extensions on the Communication resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve communication information.

# Profile Purpose #

The purpose of this profile is to allow a record of a communication even if it is planned or has failed. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organisations, or devices. Communication use cases include: 
- A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider 
- A recorded notification from a nurse to the on-call physician (or any other specified person) that a patient's temperature exceeds a value 
- A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency 
- Educational material sent by a provider to an individual 
- Unable to deliver laboratory results to the appropriate care practitioners
