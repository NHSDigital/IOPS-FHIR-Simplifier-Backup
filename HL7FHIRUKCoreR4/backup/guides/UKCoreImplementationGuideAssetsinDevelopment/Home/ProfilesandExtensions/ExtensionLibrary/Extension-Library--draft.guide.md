###  Clinical and Technical Assurance Extensions for Future Sprints

This library contains the Extensions which are proposed to be included in the UK Core for a future Clinical and Technical Assurance Sprint. These have a status of draft and a low maturity level. For more information on maturity levels see the section in the active Extensions library below. These are currently not hard-coded in the associated profiles and as part of the C&TA process may be rejected for inclusion in the UK Core active Extensions library.
