## `lotNumber`

Lot number of the vaccine product. 

Where status=`completed` this **SHOULD** be present.

This should be captured at source ideally via use of automated scanning technology (GS1 GTIN / NTIN standard).

XML
``` xml
<lotNumber value="R04X"/>
```

JSON
```json
{
   "lotNumber": "R04X",
   }
```
