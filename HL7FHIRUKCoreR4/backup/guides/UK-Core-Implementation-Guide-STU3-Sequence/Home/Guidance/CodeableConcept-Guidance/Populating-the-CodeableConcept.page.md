## Populating the CodeableConcept

This section shows you how to populate each field where the code carried is a SNOMED CT Concept and where itâ€™s not a SNOMED CT Concept. It also includes population scenarios with examples.

### Field by field population guidance

#### SNOMED CT

<table class="assets" title="SNOMED CT population">
<tr>
<th class="width45">Element</th>
<th class="width55">Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding</code></td>
<td>Populate this group if a SNOMED CT Concept Id is stored for the item.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.extension</code><br/><small><small>Where <code>extension.url</code> = http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/coding-sctdescid</small></small></td>
<td>The SNOMED CT Description Id recorded with the item. Only populated if a description Id exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.extension</code><br/><small><small>Where <code>extension.url</code> = https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-CodingSCTDescDisplay</small></small></td>
<td>The display of the Description Id. This SHOULD be populated if a Description Id exists, but implementers SHOULD NOT populate the extension if the selected display term is lexically identical to the text in <code>coding.display</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.system</code></td>
<td>Set to <code>http://snomed.info/sct</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.code</code></td>
<td>The SNOMED CT Concept Id stored for the item.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.display</code> </td>
<td>The text of the current preferred term of the SNOMED CT Concept Id according to the current NHS Realm Language Reference Sets.<br>
The text of the preferred term of the SNOMED CT Concept Id.<br>
The preferred term is the description specified for the concept in the NHS realm description subset. The preferred term for a concept may change over time. The sending system SHOULD determine the current preferred term for the concept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.userSelected</code></td>
<td>Set to <code>true</code> if a user selected the SNOMED CT Concept when creating/updating this item. If this is <code>false</code> then this element SHALL NOT be populated by the supplying system. <br>
For consuming systems the absence of this element therefore indicates that it is <code>false</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.text</code></td>
<td>The original text selected / manually entered by the user for the item. <br>
If the text displayed to the user when they entered the code on the system is not lexically identical to the term of the code then the displayed text SHALL be populated here. <br>
<b>Note:</b> This occurs when either the original entry was not coded or the original coding has been lost.</td>
</tr>

#### Other coding

<table class="assets" title="Other coding population">
<tr>
<th class="width45">Element</th>
<th class="width55">Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding</code></td>
<td>Populate this group if a clinical code other than SNOMED CT is stored for the item. If there are multiple codes (that is, the item has been translated multiple times) there is a group entry per code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.extension</code><br/><small><small>Where <code>extension.url</code> = http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/coding-sctdescid</small></small></td>
<td><b>Note:</b> Do not use here if coding is not SNOMED CT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.extension</code><br/><small><small>Where <code>extension.url</code> = https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-CodingSCTDescDisplay</small></small></td>
<td><b>Note:</b> Do not use here if coding is not SNOMED CT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.system</code></td>
<td>The identification of the code system that defines the meaning of the symbol in the code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.code</code></td>
<td>The clinical code associated with the item.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.coding.display</code></td>
<td>The longest character length variant text associated with the current preferred term for the clinical code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><code>code.coding.userSelected</code></td>
<td>Set to <code>true</code> if a user selected this code when creating/updating this item. If this is <code>false</code> then this element SHALL NOT be populated by the supplying system.<br>
For consuming systems the absence of this element therefore indicates that it is <code>false</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>code.text</code></td>
<td>The original text selected / manually entered by the user for the item. <br>
If the text displayed to the user when they entered the code on the system is not lexically identical to the term of the code then the displayed text SHALL be populated here. <br>
<b>Note:</b> This occurs when either the original entry was not coded or the original coding has been lost.</td>
