## Profile Specific Implementation Guidance: ##

The UKCore-Observation-VitalSigns-OxygenSaturation profile further derives from {{pagelink:Profile-Observation-VitalSigns,text:UKCore-Observation-VitalSigns}} and this page only shows the differences between the two. Refer to {{pagelink:Profile-Observation,text:UKCore-Observation}} and {{pagelink:Profile-Observation-VitalSigns,text:UKCore-Observation-VitalSigns}} for more implementation guidance.
