## Hazard Description
There are a number of differences to the way that each application displays the data which could result in user confusion. For example, current beta version for Medication Section headings and content structure is not as 'clear' as it could be.

## Potential Clinical Impact
Clinical information may be presented in an unfamiliar order, or in an  unexpected format. 
This may lead to important clinical information being missed, leading to a delay to the assessment/treatment of the patient, and potentially inappropriate care.

## Possible Causes
There are no national standards on the presentation layer. 

## Existing Controls
Implementation guidance is issued re presentation of key clinical information e.g. medications.

## Design
Include presentation guidance when available from national sources e.g. National patient safety agency.


## Test
This is tested as part of test harness for the transfer of care and example renderer to show example presentation.
