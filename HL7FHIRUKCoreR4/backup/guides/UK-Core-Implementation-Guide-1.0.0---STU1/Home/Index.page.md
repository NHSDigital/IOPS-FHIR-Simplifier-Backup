## UK Core Implementation Guide 1.0.0 - STU1 ##

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-information"></i><h4> Project Description and Scope.</h4>

The UK Core Implementation Guide as a project aims to provide UK wide FHIR implementation guidance that has applicability across jurisdictions and care settings.
The guidance includes: 
<ul>
<li>FHIR Resource profiles and extensions</li>
<li>FHIR Terminology components including ValueSets and CodeSystems</li>
<li>Other general guidance useful to FHIR implementers in the UK</li>
</ul>
<br>
The guidance does not form the basis for a completely described deployable service in and of itself but is the basis from which other FHIR implementation guides can be derived.
<br><br>
The content is relevant to the UK as a whole (4 Nations) although some nation specific CodeSystems are included and referenced in ValueSets.
