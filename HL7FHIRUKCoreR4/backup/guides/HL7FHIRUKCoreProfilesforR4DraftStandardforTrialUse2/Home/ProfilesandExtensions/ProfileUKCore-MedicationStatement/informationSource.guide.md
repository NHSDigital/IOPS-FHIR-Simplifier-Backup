## `informationSource`

Referencing an organization is likely to be more useful than a person. Individuals work patterns and/or employer may change while the care setting organisation is likely to be more static and relevant within historic instances of this resource.

When referencing an organisation - the following must be provided:

- `Organization.contact.name`
- `Organization.contact.telecom`
- `Organisation.identifier.odsOrganizationCode` or `Organization.identifier.odsSiteCode`

Where the organisation is an Acute Trust, an ODS Site Code may be more useful than the parent Trust-wide ODS organisation code.
