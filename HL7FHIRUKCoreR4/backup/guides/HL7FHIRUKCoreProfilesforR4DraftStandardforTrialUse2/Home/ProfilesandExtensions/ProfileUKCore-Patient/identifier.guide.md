## `identifier`

In England this should include the patient's NHS number, additional identifiers can also be added.

The extension `Patient.identifier:nhsNumber.extension:nhsNumberVerificationStatus` should be populated to indicate the verification status of the NHS number with a code from the {{pagelink:ValueSetUKCoreNHSNumberVerificationStatus-Index}}.
