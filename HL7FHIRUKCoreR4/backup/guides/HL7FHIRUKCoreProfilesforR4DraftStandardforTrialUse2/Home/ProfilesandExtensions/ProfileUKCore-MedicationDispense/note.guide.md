## `note`

Not required as part of a minimum viable product; however, if this field is populated, the receiving system **must** consume the information in the event that it contains important information (and should be treat as required) <span class="mro-circle required"></span>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-information"></i><h3>Important</h3>If the system offers an end-user the option to create a <code>note</code>, it is advised that the scope of the <code>note</code> should be the dispense event only.</div>
