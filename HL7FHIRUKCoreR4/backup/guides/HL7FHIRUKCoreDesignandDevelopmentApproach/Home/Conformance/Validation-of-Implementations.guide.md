### UK Core Validation
The UK Core is validated for quality purposes in several ways:

- The GitHub repo has HAPI based code to validate the FHIR assets are valid against the FHIR R4 standard.
- The Simplifier development platform has built in validation of content on loading and creation.

### Derived Implementation Validation
Implementers SHOULD validate their implementations against the UK Core using a HAPI based validator if they are claiming conformance to the UK Core. There is no current approved validator but work is ongoing to clarify guidance on how validation should be done.
