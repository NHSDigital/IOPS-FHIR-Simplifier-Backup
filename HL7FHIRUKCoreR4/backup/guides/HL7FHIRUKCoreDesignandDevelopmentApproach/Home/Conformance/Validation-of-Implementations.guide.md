### UK Core Validation
The UK Core is validated for quality purposes in several ways:

- The <a href="https://github.com/NHSDigital/FHIR-Validation">NHS England validation service</a> has HAPI based code to validate the FHIR assets and terminologies are valid against the FHIR R4 standard. This is open source and can be used by anyone.
- The Simplifier platform has a <a href="https://simplifier.net/docs/qualitycontrol">Quality Control Engine</a> that is used to capture any quality control issues.

### Derived Implementation Validation
Implementers SHOULD validate their implementations against the UK Core using a FHIR based validator if they are claiming conformance to the UK Core. There is no current approved validator but work is ongoing to clarify guidance on how validation should be done.
