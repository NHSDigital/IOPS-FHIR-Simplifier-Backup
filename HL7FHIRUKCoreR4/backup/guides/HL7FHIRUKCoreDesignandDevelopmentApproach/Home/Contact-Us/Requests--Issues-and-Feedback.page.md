Feedback and review comments must be submitted as a Simplifier issue. Issues should be logged at the level of the FHIR Simplifier resource.

It is acknowledged that not everyone will have enough knowledge of FHIR Implementation Guides or Simplifier to log an issue to the correct Simplifier resource (see note below) and therefore logging at the project level is allowable if this is the case. 

All issues will be processed internally by the UK Core team, prioritised accordingly and may be escalated to the UK FHIR board if needed. Major updates to the issue will be communicated via the Simpifier issue ticket.

See below on how to create an Sumplifier issue ticket.

## Instructions for raising an Issue within Simplifier

### Creating a Simplifier Account
Although the UK Core is in the public domain, you will need to <a href="https://simplifier.net/signup">create an account</a> to raise issues. A username, email address and a chosen password are the only details needed to set up an account.

### Navigation to the UK Core Project

The FHIR Assets are stored within the <a href="https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/" target="_blank">HL7 FHIRÂ® UK Core R4</a> project in Simplifier. 

When the change request is for a change to an existing UK Core FHIR asset, the preferred approach is to raise the issue at the level of the relevant asset.

### Create a Simplifier issue at UK Core Asset level

Issue logging at asset level is the preferred approach, as it makes triage of issues easier.

The simplest way is to click the "feedback" tab on any asset within the Implementation Guide, which will look similar to the example below.

<div class="tab fhirTree">
 <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Tree View')">Tree View</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Detailed View')">Detailed View</button>
   <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Table View')">Table View</button>
   <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'XML View')">XML View</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'JSON View')">JSON View</button>
  <!--<button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Usage')">Usage</button>-->
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'Examples')">Examples</button>
  <button class="tablinks active" onclick="openTab(event, 'Feedback')">Feedback</button>
</div>

<br><br>

Otherwise:

- Search for the asset under the <a href="https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/~resources?category=Profile|ValueSet|CodeSystem|Extension|SearchParameter|CompartmentDefinition|CapabilityStatement|OperationDefinition|NamingSystem|ConceptMap|StructureMap|GraphDefinition|ExpansionProfile|Example&fhirVersion=R4&sortBy=DisplayName">Resources tab</a>.

- Select the asset and navigate to the 'Issues' tab.

- Create a new issue and give as much detail as neccessary to help understand the problem. Email notifications will be created upon any status changes and replies to the issue.

If you cannot locate the Simplifier resource, or it is not appropriate to log an issue at the Simplifier resource level, then you should raise an issue at the project level. In this case, the title and/or issue text should identify which part of the UK Core Implementation is the subject of the issue being raised.

### Creating a Simplifier Issue at Project Level

To create a issue at the project level, <a href="https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/~issues" target="_blank">navigate to the project</a>. Once you are in the project, click on the "Issues" tab and then the "New issue" button to create a new issue.

## Requesting a new UK Core Asset
Issues for new UK Core FHIR assets should be raised at the UK Core project level the issue must indicate the use case or details of the requirement as to why the new asset is needed.
