# Introduction

This is the design and development approach used to produce the UK Core. It serves several purposes, for example:
- It is to allow implementers of the UK Core to understand how and why the UK Core has been produced. 
- To allow interested parties to get involved in these processes and become part of the UK Core development team
- To facilitate suggestions for improvement to these processes 
- To allow the processes used and documentation to be submitted for endorsement by various bodies, for example the NHS England Data Alliance Partnership Board (DAPB). Where this is the case this specification is the collection of defined processes and guidance which will form the main part of any submission.
