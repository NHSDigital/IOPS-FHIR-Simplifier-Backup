# Engagement

This section is about engagement with stakeholders. The UK Core has many stakeholders with very differing knowledge levels and interests. Stakeholders of the UK Core are often referred to using the term "The FHIR Community"; this is used to refer to anyone who has any interest in FHIR in the UK.   
The {{pagelink:Clinical-and-Technical-Assurance}} process details how stakeholders are engaged as part of assuring the UK Core.   
The pages in this section contain information about how the UK Core development team has engaged with the FHIR Community via presentations and information sharing sessions.
