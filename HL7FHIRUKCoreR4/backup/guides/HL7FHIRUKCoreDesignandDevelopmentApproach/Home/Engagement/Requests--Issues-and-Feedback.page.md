## {{page-title}}

Simplifier holds all <a href="https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4">HL7 FHIR® UK Core R4</a> source files, with the Implementation Guide (IG) being a human readable html view of the project. 
Feedback and review comments must be submitted as a Simplifier issue. Issues should be logged at the level of the FHIR Simplifier resource.

It is acknowledged that not everyone will have enough knowledge of FHIR Implementation Guides or Simplifier to log an issue to the correct Simplifier resource (see note below) and therefore logging at the project level is allowable if this is the case. 

**Note: Simplifier refers to everything as a resource whether it’s an image, example or FHIR profile**

All issues will be processed internally by the UK Core team, prioritised accordingly and may be escalated to the UK FHIR board if needed. Major updates to the issue will be communicated via the Simpifier issue ticket.

## Requesting a new UK Core Asset

## Instructions for raising an Issue within Simplifier

### Creating a Simplifier Account
Although the UK Core is in the public domain, you will need to <a href="https://simplifier.net/signup">create an account</a> to raise issues. A username, email address and a chosen password are the only details needed to set up an account.

### Navigation to the UK Core Project

The FHIR Assets are stored within the <a href="https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/" target="_blank">HL7 FHIR® UK Core R4</a> project in Simplifier. 

When the change request is for a change to an existing UK Core FHIR asset, the preferred approach is to raise the issue at the level of the relevant asset.

### Create a Simplifier issue at UK Core Asset level

Issue logging at asset level is the preferred approach, as it makes triage of issues easier.    

**Note: Simplifier refers to everything as a resource whether it’s an image, example or FHIR profile and provides a mechanism to filter on type.**

- Search for the asset under the 'Resources' tab.

- Select the asset and navigate to the 'Issues' tab.

- Create a new issue and give as much detail as neccessary to help understand the problem. Email notifications will be created upon any status changes and replies to the issue.


If you cannot locate the Simplifier resource, or it is not appropriate to log an issue at the Simplifier resource level, then you should raise an issue at the project level. In this case, the title and/or issue text should identify which part of the UK Core Implementation is the subject of the issue being raised.

### Creating a Simplifier Issue at Project Level

To create a issue at the project level, <a href="https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/~issues" target="_blank">navigate to the project</a>. Once you are in the project, click on the "Issues" tab and then the "New issue" button to create a new issue.
