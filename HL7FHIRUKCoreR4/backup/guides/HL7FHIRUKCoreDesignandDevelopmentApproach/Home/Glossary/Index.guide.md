<td>ACF</td>
<td>Access Control Framework. Access to NHS Care Records Service data (on Spine) is controlled by the ACF which registers and authenticates all users. It provides a single log-in and a record of each healthcare professional accessing a patient’s NHS care record.
<br><br>
All information is provided on a need-to-know basis and based on a user’s role and legitimate relationship with the patient. It stores the details of those relationships between healthcare professionals and patients, as well as patient preferences on information sharing (such as whether certain sensitive information is restricted from routine sharing).</td>

<td>Active patient</td>
<td>An Active patient as defined by GP Connect is any patient on a providers system that has Not Left and is Not Deceased. The concept of Active is related to the patient’s registration status rather than to the patients registration type.
<br><br>
A provider's system may have a number of different statuses which should be considered Active. Many of those statuses may apply to a number of different registration type. Below is a basic example of a possible GP Practice representation of patient registration type and registration status, to help explain the concept of an Active patient within GP Connect.</td>

<td>API</td>
<td>The term Application Programming Interface is quite a confused term in the context of FHIR. Strictly speaking, an API is a set or services offered by a programming library that can be made use of by another application. Historically these would have been made available from a single machine although now they are available across networks.
<br><br>
In the service/message/document categorisation, an API is a service interface. As technology became increasingly capable of supporting distributed operations, the differences between SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and API became blurred. In the context of FHIR we define APIs as REST based interfaces.</td>
