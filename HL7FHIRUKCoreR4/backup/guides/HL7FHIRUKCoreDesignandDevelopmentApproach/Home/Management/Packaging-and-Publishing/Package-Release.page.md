## Package Release

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following has been checks have been completed:
-	All relevant Jira tickets are complete
-	Ensure all GitHub PR's are complete
-	Merge develop (hotfix) into relevant main (release)


### Publishing a Package
Note that the following must be done within a virtual machine due to NHS firewall restrictions.

<ol>
<li>Within the Simplifier Project reimport Github.
<br><br>
{{render:igimport}}
<br><br></li>
<li>Within the same menu, check the GitHub repository settings. 
<br><br>
The Repository include/exclude textbox should be as the following:

```
#by default, everything is included 
#if some include statements are added, we will exclude everything by default 
#Simplifier imports only xml, json, images, css, yaml and markdown file types 

#Include examples: 
# FHIR/IG/** 
# *.xml 

#Exclude examples: 
# !FHIR/*.img 
# !*.cs 
# !FHIR/examples/* 

# Exclude all capability statement files: 
!CapabilityStatement/*
```
 
This ensures that the capability statement is not copied into the npm package.
If the textbox had to be updated open the file manager, search for “capability” and if there delete.
<br><br>
{{render:igfilemanager}}
<br><br>
{{render:igcapabilitystatement}}
</ol>

### Creation of the NPM Package

<ol>
<li>Create the new package for the relevant version
<br><br>
{{render:ignewpackage}}
<br><br></li>
<li>Enter the version number. This should be in the format of x.x.x(-aaa) where x denotes a number and (-aaa) denote an optional lowercase string. For example, 1.0.0-pre-release.
