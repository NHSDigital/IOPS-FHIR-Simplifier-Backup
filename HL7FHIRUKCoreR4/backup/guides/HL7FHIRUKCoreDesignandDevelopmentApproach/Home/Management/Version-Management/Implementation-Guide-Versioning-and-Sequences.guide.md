The versioning approach to the UK Core Implementation Guide releases are based on the FHIR Standard and is summarised below.

There are three numbers used with the versioning in the format n.n.n for example 0.3.0. The following rules apply:

- The first number is linked to the HL7 UK Ballot process and is always 0 until the release has been though the Ballot process
- The second number is incremented for every development release
- The third number can also be incremented for patch a development 

The version number will formally be agreed for each release by the UK Core Development Team in consultation with HL7 UK.

### The Release Sequence
The UK Core uses similar release sequences as the FHIR standard, these are:

- Draft
- Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU)
- Standard for Trial Use (STU)
- Normative

### Draft 
This is for when FHIR assets are in development this status is only used in the HL7 FHIRÂ® Draft UK Core Profiles (Draft) Simplifier project.

### Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU)
This is used for early development of the UK Core

### Standard for Trial Use (STU)
This is the sequence used for the UK Core release when its ready for the HL7 ballot process. This version of the release is relatively stable because it has been though the {{pagelink:clinical-and-technical-assurance}} process and all known/raised issues resolved and agreed. The HL7 UK Ballot process is the final endorsement of the release of the UK Core. There will be a number of releases of the STU sequence which will be denoted by the number STU1, STU2, STU3 etc...

### Normative
This is the final status of the UK Core release which has passed the HL7 UK ballot process and has been proven by multiple implementations of the UK Core.

### Releases

Each of the sequences will have a major release number to indicate the release within the sequence for example:-

- STU1 indicates it is the first release in the sequence STU (Standard for Trial Use)
- STU2 indicates it is the second release in the sequence STU (Standard for Trial Use)

The release aligns with the HL7 UK Ballot process, and the major version number of the Implementation Guide reflects this. There is only one major release per sequence and likewise only one HL7 UK Ballot. There will be multiple minor releases and maybe some patch releases.
