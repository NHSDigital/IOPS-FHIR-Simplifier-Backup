### Overview
Simplifier is the chosen platform for UK Core development. Further information about Simplifier can be found on the [Simplifier homepage](https://simplifier.net).

### Simplifier Projects
The UK Core consists of a collection of projects and Implementation Guides. These are developed and released using the Simplifier platform in an [organisation account](https://simplifier.net/organization/hl7uk) owned by HL7 UK. 
There are two [projects](https://simplifier.net/organization/hl7uk/~projects) used for the UK Core and related Implementation Guides.

- [HL7 FHIR速 UK Core R4](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4) - The UK Core project which contains the FHIR assets and Implementation Guides at various stages of the development and release cycles.
- [UK FHIR Community Assets](https://simplifier.net/ukfhircommunityassets) - A HL7 UK project that contains other assets and guides important for FHIR implementers in the UK.

There are also other HL7 UK projects:
- HL7 FHIR速 UK Core R4 STU*x* Sequence - Where *x* denotes the version. These are R4 projects allowing the separation of individual STU Sequence packages for administration purposes only. This will have no effect on the user and all the relevant Implementation Guides will still be found within the [HL7 FHIR速 UK Core R4](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4) project.
-  [HL7 FHIR速 CareConnect Baseline for STU3](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3)  - This is project for the CareConnect STU3 FHIR assets and guides. This project is not directly related to the UK Core but was used as input in the early development of the UK Core.  There is currently work in progress to map the CareConnect FHIR assets to UK Core FHIR assets to help implementers migrate to UK Core.    

### Simplifier Implementation Guides

The [UK Core Version History](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreversionhistory?version=current) contains links to every UK Core Implementation Guide that has been released.


[UK Core Implementation Guidance Directory](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guidance-directory?version=current) contains links to supplementary UK Core guides, along with other guidance and documentation deemed useful to implementers of the UK Core.
