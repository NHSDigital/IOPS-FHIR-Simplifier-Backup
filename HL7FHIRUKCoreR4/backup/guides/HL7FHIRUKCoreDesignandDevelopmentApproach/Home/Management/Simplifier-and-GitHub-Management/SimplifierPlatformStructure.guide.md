### Overview

The UK Core consists of a collection of projects and Implementation Guides. These are developed and released using the Simplifier platform in an [organisation account](https://simplifier.net/organization/hl7uk) owned by HL7 UK. 
There are two [projects](https://simplifier.net/organization/hl7uk/~projects) used for the UK Core and related Implementation Guides.

- [HL7 FHIR® UK Core R4](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4) - The UK Core project which contains the FHIR assets and Implementation Guides at various stages of the development and release cycles.
- [UK FHIR Community Assets](https://simplifier.net/ukfhircommunityassets) - A HL7 UK project that contains other assets and guides important for FHIR implementers in the UK.

There are also other HL7 UK projects:
- HL7 FHIR® UK Core R4 STU*x* Sequence - Where *x* denotes the version. These are R4 projects allowing the separation of individual STU Sequence packages for administration purposes only. This will have no effect on the user and all the relevant Implementation Guides will still be found within the [HL7 FHIR® UK Core R4](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4) project.
-  [HL7 FHIR® CareConnect Baseline for STU3](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhircareconnectbaselineforstu3)  - This is project for the CareConnect STU3 FHIR assets and guides. This project is not directly related to the UK Core but was used as input in the early development of the UK Core. This version is now deprecated.
