For some SNOMED CT and dm+d ValueSets, where the expansion would contain a list of concepts larger than 600, they will not be expanded so that the viewers do not misinterpret a partially expanded list as a full list. 

Note that expansions are only ever current at the time they are created. The date/time of expansion is currently only viewable from within the XML or JSON view of the ValueSet.

It is possible to manually obtain a ValueSet expansion from the NHS England Terminology Server (Ontoserver), and this expansion can be manually incorporated into an existing ValueSet. This approach was taken for the ValueSet examples above.
