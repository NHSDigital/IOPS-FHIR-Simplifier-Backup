# Assurance and Endorsement

### Assurance
To ensure that the UK Core is both clinically and technically assured and appropriate for UK use, assurance encompasses both a clear governance structure and an agreed Clinical and Technical Assurance approach.

#### Governance Structure
To support a UK wide and collaborative approach to improving UK health and social care interoperability, a {{pagelink:UK-Core-Governance-Structure}} with widespread stakeholder engagement has been established at two levels:  

- {{pagelink:HL7-UK-FHIR-Board}} - To set strategy, policy and priorities for all stakeholders
- {{pagelink:UK-FHIR-Delivery-Senior-Leadership-Team}} â€“ Overseeing the creation and management of changes to FHIR assets

### Clinical and Technical Assurance
The UK Core {{pagelink:Clinical-and-Technical-Assurance}} process involves a team of subject matter experts who use their knowledge to ensure assets are effectively and safely customised for UK use.

### Endorsement
Once the required asset development is completed and associated implementation guidance produced, the standard is put to {{pagelink:HL7-UK-Ballot-Process}}. The ballot allows for issues to be raised and resolved as part of a collaborative process.
