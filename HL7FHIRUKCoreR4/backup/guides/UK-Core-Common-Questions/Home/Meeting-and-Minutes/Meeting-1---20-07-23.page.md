### Meeting Minutes

- Using Zulip as the TIG forum was an overwhelming yes. Creating a UK TIG stream rather than a thread within the UK stream will allow multiple issues and their responses to be separate within the stream. The stream can be found at <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/397821-UK-Core-TIG">UK Core TIG</a>.

- Paradigms / APIs where both voted the highest on what attendees wanted as the next agenda item. Both will be the next agenda items.

- (Optional) TIG members to review the proposed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1thx0mYcfJLernr3XDxZEOSNa1gWhzRYs">UK Core TIG Terms of Reference</a>. Comments can be added directly to the document. If you have difficulties accessing and would like a copy of the document, email <a href="mailto:interoperabilityteam@nhs.net?Subject=UK Core">the Interoperability Team</a>.
