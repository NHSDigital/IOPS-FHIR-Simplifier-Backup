## R5 Delta

This section is a look ahead and highlights any changes that have been made in <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r5/resourcelist.html">FHIR R5 </a> in comparison to the equivalent <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu3-sequence/Home/ProfilesandExtensions/Sprint-7-Proposals?version=1.7.0">UK Core Profiles</a> for this C&TA sprint. This may be used to propose the backporting of new features into R4 via extensions, as per the offical guidance <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#extensions">on using new element in older versions of FHIR</a>.

- **Note 1:** Only the changes are listed, elements that are unchanged are not provided due to table size. Changes to references from a base profile to the UK Core replacement are also not shown.
- **Note 2:** There is a comparison of extensions section.
- **Note 3:** The UK Core FHIR assets follow a set of <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/HL7FHIRUKCoreDesignandDevelopmentApproach/Home/DevelopmentandPublication/FHIRAssets#DesignPrinciples" target="_blank">UK Core design principles</a>. These principles were created based on feedback from implementers and NHS England SMEs and are used for the creation of all the current UK Core FHIR assets. The principles are open to challenge in this C&TA sprint.
