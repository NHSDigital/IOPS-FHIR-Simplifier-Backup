## `Location`

This profile describes locations at which health and care is delivered. It can represent anything from a bed to a multi-building site. A location can be a `partOf` another location and can be linked to a `managingOrganization`.

A location can represent an actual physical location or a class(type) of location see <code>location.mode</code> for futher infomation.

Guidance relating to locations  may be found on the {{pagelink:Profile-Location-9738cf88-9ba3-4fc6-8efb-58b9583498f2}} page.


Be careful not confuse location with organisation. Use location to specify a physical location or class of locations. Use organisation to specify the legally responsible organisation.
