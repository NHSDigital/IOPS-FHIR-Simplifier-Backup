<td>Whilst the Task profile was included within the scope of UK Core Clinical &amp; Technical Assurance Sprint 5, and may be used extensively in the future in relation to bookings and referrals, it has not been used by the BaRS programme in its First of Type payloads.</td>
<td>As there is currently no specific use case for the Task profile, this profile will continue to exist in the UK Core as a "draft" profile but it will not be promoted to an "active" status as part of Sprint 5. Pages for and references to the Task profile will be removed from the Implementation Guide.</td>
