<tr>
<td>The current binding for the Appointment.specialty, HealthcareService.specialty, Schedule.specialty and Slot.specialty elements is to the FHIR standard "PracticeSettingCodeValueSet" with a "preferred" binding strength in each case.

Comments have previously been made in Sprint 1 that a UK Core ValueSet should be considered for the PractitionerRole.specialty element, and further comments supporting that position have been made against the release 0.1.0 HL7UK ballot.

The ballot comment is due to be discussed at weekly reconciliation meetings by members of the HL7UK board and others.
</td>
<td>Any UK Core decision regarding the ValueSet binding for PractitionerRole.specialty agreed by HL7UK will be applied to the Appointment.specialty, HealthcareService.specialty, Schedule.specialty and Slot.specialty elements.<br/><br/>Update 12/05/2022: Any changes agreed by HL7UK will be made in a later UK Core release.</td>
