<td>The current binding for the HealthcareService.communication element is to the FHIR standard CommonLanguages ValueSet. A comment has been made against the release 0.1.0 HL7UK ballot suggesting that consideration should be given to aligning the ValueSet binding for the Practitioner.communication and RelatedPerson.communication.language elements to the same ValueSet as with Patient.communication, which is to the UKCore-HumanLanguage ValueSet.</td>
<td>Any UK Core decision regarding the ValueSet binding for Practitioner.communication and RelatedPerson.communication.language agreed by HL7UK will be applied to the HealthcareService.communication element.</td>
