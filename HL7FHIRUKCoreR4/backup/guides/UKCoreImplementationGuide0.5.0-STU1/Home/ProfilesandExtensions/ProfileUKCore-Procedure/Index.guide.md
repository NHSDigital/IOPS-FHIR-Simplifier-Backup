## StructureDefinition-UKCore-Procedure

Defines the UK Core constraints and extensions on the Procedure resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve the patientâ€™s procedure information.

## Profile Purpose
This profile allows exchange of details of current and historical procedures performed on or for an individual. A procedure is an activity that is performed on, with, or for an individual as part of the provision of care. Examples include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, counselling, physiotherapy, personal support services, adult day care services, non-emergency transportation, home modification, exercise, etc. Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a service provider, a friend or relative or in some cases by themselves.
