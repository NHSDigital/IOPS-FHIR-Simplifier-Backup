## `recordedDate`

The date the first version of the resource instance was recorded.

The recordedDate represents when this particular AllergyIntolerance record was created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.

If the instance of the resource is updated via an operation like a RESTful `PATCH` or `PUT` then the `recordedDate` is not updated and remains the date the resource instance was recorded.
