## `active`

A `boolean` value indicating if the patient's record is in current use.

Many systems use this property to mark as non-current patients, such as those that have not been seen for a period of time based on an organisation's business rules.

It can also be use to mark a duplicate record created in error with the link element pointing to the active record.
