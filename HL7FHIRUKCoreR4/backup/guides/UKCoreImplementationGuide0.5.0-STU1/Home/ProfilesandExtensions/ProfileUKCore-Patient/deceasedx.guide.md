## `deceased`

Either:
 
A `boolean` value indicating the patient is dead
 
or
 
The `DateTime` of death
 
Where the patient is alive sending systems can omit this element, it is not necessary to include it to indicate that the patient is not dead.
 
Where this element is missing, receiving systems can assume the patient is alive.
