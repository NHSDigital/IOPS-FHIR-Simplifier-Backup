This element currently uses the FHIR example <a href="https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r4.core/4.0.1/files/80979">Service Request Order Details Codes ValueSet</a> consisting of 5 selected SNOMED concepts, as no UK Core ValueSet has been defined.

The use of text might be considered more appropriate for the type of data that the definition describes. Therefore this element should be used with caution as there is no specific UK use case identified for it.
