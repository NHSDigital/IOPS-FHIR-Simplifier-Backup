**For Information Only**. Example of a DiagnosticReport for DPYD indicating a patient is a poor metaboliser for Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Diagnostic reports from genomic services are expected to either attach the PDF report through the `presentedForm` element (either as a base64 encoded attachment or URL reference to the location where the PDF can be retrieved), or follow guidance provided within the [HL7 Genomic Reporting Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/index.html) for structured reporting.
