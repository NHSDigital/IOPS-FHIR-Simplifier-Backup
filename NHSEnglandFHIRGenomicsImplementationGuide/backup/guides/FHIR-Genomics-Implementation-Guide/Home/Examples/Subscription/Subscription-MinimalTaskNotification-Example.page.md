## {{page-title}}

Example of a Subscription resource for setting up alerting when a Task is assigned to an organization. NOTE: In future, owners will be referenced by identifier rather than using resource references (see {{pagelink:Profile-Genomics-Task}} for details). The exact subscription/notification mechanism used by the central broker is pending testing in the GMS Alpha.
