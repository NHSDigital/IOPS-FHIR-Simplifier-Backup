It is expected that errors will be returned in the same way as other NHS Digital services, i.e. through return of OperationOutcome resources, with appropriate NHS Digital/SPINE error codes. More information on SPINE error handling can be found on the [NHS Developer pages](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core-1-0/resources_error_handling.html).

This page will be updated with specific guidance on how errors should be handled once alternative flows (including the types of errors which may occur) have been defined.
