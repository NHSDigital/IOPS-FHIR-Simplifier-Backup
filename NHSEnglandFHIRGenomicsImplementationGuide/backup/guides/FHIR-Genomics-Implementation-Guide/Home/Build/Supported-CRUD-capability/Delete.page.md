It is not expected that delete operations will be supported by the central service for workflow based resources, e.g. if a service request or task was created in error. Cancellations or marking resources as entered in error SHOULD be represented using the associated status on the resources rather than deleting them from the central service to ensure auditability. However, if a clinical resource is no longer relevant, this may require a delete. Though additional logic will need to be added to the central service to ensure referential integrity and notifications if deletes constitute material changes affecting the processing of a test request. The Information Governance implications of limiting deletion of resources will be investigated within the Alpha phase of the project.
