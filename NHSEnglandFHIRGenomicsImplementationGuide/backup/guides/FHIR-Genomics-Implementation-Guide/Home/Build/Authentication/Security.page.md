It is expected only active healthcare professionals, within particular specialties, will be able to order Genetic tests and only recipient GLHs/labs or requesting clinicians will be able to view tasks related to a test order. 

Finally, it is expected only clinicians responsible for interpretation of a genetic test, or the clinician responsible for care of the patient will be able to access the Diagnostic Report produced, subject to standard break-glass procedures.
