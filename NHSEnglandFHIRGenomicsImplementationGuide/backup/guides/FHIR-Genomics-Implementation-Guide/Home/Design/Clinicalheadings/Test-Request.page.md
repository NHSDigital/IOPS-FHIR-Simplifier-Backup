### Purpose
Elements are included for the billing approach, TAT/SLA tracking and prioritisation.
To confirm validity of urgency and apply lower level prioritisation. To know which test has been requested, which further tests are required within this request and how many patients are being tested within this request.

### Notes
Mapped to ServiceRequest, extensions are still in review. CI and CITT codes for genomic tests are pending addition to SNOMED-CT
