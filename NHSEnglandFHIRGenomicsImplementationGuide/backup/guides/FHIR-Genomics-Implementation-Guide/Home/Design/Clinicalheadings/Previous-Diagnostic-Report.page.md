### Purpose
To locate previous **Non-Genomic** diagnostic test reports linked to this service request.

### Notes
Mapped to DiagnosticReport.
Observations/test results within the DiagnosticReport are expected to be included as referenced Observation resources.
It is expected previous diagnostic reports will have a minimal amount of information coded for automated interpretation but reports can be attached as PDF documents or references to their location provided, as with Genomic reports.
