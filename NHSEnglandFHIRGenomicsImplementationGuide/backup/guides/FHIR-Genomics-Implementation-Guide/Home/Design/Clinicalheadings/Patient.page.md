### Purpose
To track a patient, identify within shared systems and maintain complete records.
To apply processes applicable to deceased patient requests, patient contact and urgency purposes.
Data needed to support genetic interpretation, for PLCM to locate further patient ODS codes for a given test and to link patients to potential family members and their genetic results.

### Notes
Mapped to Patient resource, extensions not in UKCore are under review. Representation of Karyotypic Sex is through an Observation with code under Karyotype (cell structure) - SCTID: 734840008 or Anomaly of sex chromosome (disorder) - SCTID: 95462004 (these codes are under review). Representation of pregnancy and gestation is under discussion.

It is expected that practitioner and organization details for GPs will be referenced from Patient.generalPractitioner (e.g. using ODS/SDS identifiers) rather than be included as FHIR resources within Test Request payloads, though the full FHIR mapping has been provided below for completeness.

For Life Status at time of request for Foetal records, as per PRSB guidance, this should be inferred through outcome codes attached to the Pregnancy observation.

e.g. under Observation with code 77386006, ```Observation.component.valueCodeableConcept (with Observation.component.code = 267013003 | Past pregnancy outcome (observable entity) |)```

The component SNOMED codes SHOULD match the following list to map from foetal life statuses:

|PRSB Prgnancy Outcome|GEL Foetal Life Status|SNOMED CT Pregnancy Outcome Code|
|--|--|--|
|01	Live birth|N/A - not included in GEL list|281050002 - Livebirth (finding) (or captured through Patient.extension:bornStatus)|
|02	Antepartum Stillbirth|stillborn|713202001 - Antepartum stillbirth (finding)|
|03	Intrapartum Stillbirth|stillborn|921611000000101 - Intrapartum stillbirth (finding)|
|04	Stillbirth â€“ timing unknown|stillborn|237364002 - Stillbirth (finding)|
|05	Termination of Pregnancy equal to or greater than 24 weeks|aborted|57797005 - Induced termination of pregnancy (disorder)|
|98	Other (not listed)|N/A not part of GEL life status ValueSet|potentially captured through Patient.extension:bornStatus = unknown|
|N/A not mapped exactly to PRSB ValueSet|miscarriage|17369002 - Miscarriage (disorder)|
|N/A no pregnancy outcome code|unborn|N/A no pregnancy outcome code (captured through Patient.extension:bornStatus)|


**Profiling for Procedure is currently in progress**
