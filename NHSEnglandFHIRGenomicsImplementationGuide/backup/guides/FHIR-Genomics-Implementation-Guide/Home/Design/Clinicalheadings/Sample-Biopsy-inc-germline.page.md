### Purpose
To track samples, direct storage, handling and testing decisions including ensuring volumes received match what was sent.
Further detail which may support testing and interpretation.
To enable patient to opt out of having a sample/biopsy stored.

### Notes
Mapped to Specimen.
Extensions lifted from mCODE are currently under review.
Observation codes linked to samples are pending addition to SNOMED-CT

**Additional observation code fields from MDS v0.55 mappings are still under review**
