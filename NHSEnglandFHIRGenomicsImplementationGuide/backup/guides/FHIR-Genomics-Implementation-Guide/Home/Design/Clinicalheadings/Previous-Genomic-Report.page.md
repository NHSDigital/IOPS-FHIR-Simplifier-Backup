### Purpose
To locate previous genomic test reports linked to this service request.

### Notes
Mapped to DiagnosticReport.
It is expected previous genomic reports will be attached as PDF documents or references to their location will be provided within the genomic test order. Structured genomic reports will be investigated in future stages of the Genomic Medicine Service. 
Metadata regarding patient/performer details are expected to match previous mappings for these headings above.
