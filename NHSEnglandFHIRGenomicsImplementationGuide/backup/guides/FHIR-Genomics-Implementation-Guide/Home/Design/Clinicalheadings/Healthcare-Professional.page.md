### Purpose
To record details regarding a HCP that is associated with a test order. 
To know who to contact with questions or clinical results and how they should be contacted.

### Notes
Mapped to PractitionerRole. The requestor is mapped to ServiceRequest.requestor. Usage of HealthcareService and Location resources still to be determined.

It is expected that practitioner and organization details will be referenced from PractitionerRole resources (e.g. using ODS/SDS identifiers) rather than be included as FHIR resources within Test Request payloads, though the full FHIR mapping has been provided below for completeness.
