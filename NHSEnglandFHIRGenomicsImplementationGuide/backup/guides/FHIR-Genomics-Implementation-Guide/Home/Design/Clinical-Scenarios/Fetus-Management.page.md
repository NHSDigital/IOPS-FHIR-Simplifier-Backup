The following scenarios have been captured to indicate various specialist testing scenarios associated with testing for either the mother or the fetus:

- **Mother is pregnant and testing is on mother** (e.g., prenatal testing): The test request is created on the mother’s record and the sample taken is from the mother.
  - Confirmation of if the patient has been diagnosed with cancer or is undergoing treatment becomes mandatory 
- **Mother is pregnant and the specialist testing is on the mother** (e.g., NIPD): The test request is created on the mother’s record and the sample taken is from the mother.
  - Confirmation of if the patient has been diagnosed with cancer or is undergoing treatment becomes mandatory 
- **Mother is pregnant and testing is on the Fetus** (e.g., CVS or amnio): The test requested is created on the mother’s record. As part of fetus testing, the following information becomes mandatory:
  - the ability  to capture test on the fetus (this may differ from local organisation to another and is typically the Mother’s Hospital ID plus indication of fetus ( Ex. WG1342Fetous A) 
  - The capture of additional information such as foetal phenotypic sex (M/F/U or Unknown) and number of fetuses also becomes mandatory.
  - Pregnancy details: capture of Pregnancy type ( Spontaneous conception, Surrogacy, or IVF Pregnancy). If IVF, the capture of own egg/sperm and the age of the egg doner becomes mandatory
  - **Note:** If fetus is under 24 weeks, the sample is from the mother 
- **Mother is pregnant, multiple fetuses and test is completed on each fetus with a result per fetus:** An electronic test request is created on the mother’s record.  A test request/ sample collection  is required for each fetus. Additional mandatory information required includes:  
  - the ability  to capture test on the fetus (this may differ from local organisation to another and is typically the Mother’s Hospital ID plus indication of fetus ( Ex. WG1342Fetous A) 
  - The capture of additional information such as foetal phenotypic sex (M/F/U or Unknown) and number of fetuses also becomes mandatory.
  - Pregnancy details: capture of Pregnancy type (Spontaneous conception, Surrogacy, or IVF Pregnancy). If IVF, the capture of own egg/sperm and the age of the egg doner becomes mandatory
- **Mother is pregnant and has had a miscarriage:** In certain scenarios, where further testing may be required on the fetus to inform the management on future pregnancies, testing may occur on the fetus.  A test request is created on the mother’s record with the confirmation of sample collected (if after 24 weeks as skin on cord).  

The requirement for electronic test order forms is to allow for configuration of specialist testing requirements and enable the management of samples associated with the fetus. Further input is required from the GMS to confirm the scenario as part of the testing phase within the Alpha.
