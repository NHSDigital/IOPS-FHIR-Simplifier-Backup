The National Genomic Medicine Service is currently delivered through seven regional GLHs. The GLHs are responsible for coordinating services for their region. Currently, all tests are routed via the Home GLH from any requester (primary, secondary, or tertiary care) within the region. For some specialist tests, a requester may directly send the test request and the sample directly to the specialist lab. R14 (as  test directory version 5.2, June 2023) is one such example. The requester will create and submit the test request and sample. The receiving lab (Exeter) will be immediately notified of the test request via messaging.

The sample may be received later (transport to Exeter) and will be reflected in the messaging as test received, awaiting sample. Confirmation is required from the GMS on if the Home GLH (i.e., the region in which the request was made, should be notified as cc from a monitoring perspective). 

The introduction of a central service will support the routing of tests to the given lab defined within the routing tables. In the event no rule exists, the test request will be defaulted to the Home GLH.
