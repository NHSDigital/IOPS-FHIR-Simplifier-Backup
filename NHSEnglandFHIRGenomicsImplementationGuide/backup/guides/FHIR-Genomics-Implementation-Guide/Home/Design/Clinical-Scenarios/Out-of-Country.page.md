In certain circumstances, genomic tests may be sent to a laboratory team outside of the UK for further analysis. One such example of a test is Oncotype DX (M3.2). Oncotype DX is currently dispatched out of the UK by courier to Genomic Health in the U.S. Currently, the oncologist partially completes the tissue requisition form prior to sending the form to the cell path department, where the requisition is married up with the breast cancer tissue block and tumour information prior to dispatching by courier to the U.S. In another scenario, (M2.5- genomic instability testing for ovarian cancer by Myriad), the local lab will collect and send the tissue to the GLH. The GLH will forward on the request and the sample and dispatch by courier to the US.
 
In both instances, a new test request is created and the sample along with the test request is forwarded by the Home GLH to any out of country partners.
