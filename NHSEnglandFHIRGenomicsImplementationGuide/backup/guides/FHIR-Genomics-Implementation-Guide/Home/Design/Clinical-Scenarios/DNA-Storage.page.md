DNA Storage (R346, R373, R332, R374) may be requested where genomic testing is likely required in the future, but further information or discussion is required prior to making the test request. In this scenario, DNA may be stored for future genomic testing or to help with testing of other family members.

The requester will create a test request electronically (e.g., R346 1) and record the reason for testing as “Stored DNA”, with the option to record the storage location (if known). The lab receives the test request in real time and samples (at a later date) and follows the current procedure for DNA storage. The requester can then indicate any subsequent electronic test requests the use of stored DNA (sample type). There would be no need to collect a new sample from the patient and the lab will activate the testing in the laboratory systems (LIMS).

**Note:** DNA storage depends on the quality/amount of DNA originally obtained and banked samples maybe used for multiple tests over multiple years.
