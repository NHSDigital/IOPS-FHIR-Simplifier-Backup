The following test types may be requested as an additional or follow up test at the lab. In these instances, the lab acts as the originating requester and may add on additional tests to validate the pathway (these tests may or may not be on the National Genomics Test Directory).

- **Confirmatory Test (R443):** use of alternative test methods to confirm the conclusions of an original genomic test requested. 
- **Reflex Test:** is the next course of action (new test request) based on the outcome of the original genomic test requested and are related to the outcomes. These tests are internal to the laboratories. 
- **Lab Recommended Testing:** management of situations where the requester has placed a test request however, the lab has replaced the test with a better option or where the optimal test could not be delivered due to sample limitations. 
- **Re-test:** based on quality or a change in what the test provides (panels) and is treated as a new test.  
In these instances, existing samples on the patient may be used by the lab to perform additional testing. 
Note: Existing DNA/RNA, Cultures may be used for testing in the future for unrelated episodes of testing.
