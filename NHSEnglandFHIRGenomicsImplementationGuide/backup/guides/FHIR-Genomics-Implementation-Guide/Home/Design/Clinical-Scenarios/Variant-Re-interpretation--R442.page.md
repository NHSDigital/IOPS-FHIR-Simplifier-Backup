The testing criteria for Variant Re-interpretation is defined in the National Genomic Test Directory as the requirement for an interpretation of a known variant to determine if the pathogenic status has changed since primary analysis and reporting or a previous re-interpretation. Re-interpretation of a variant may be performed due to:

- A request from a clinician responsible for a patient with a report variant of uncertain significance, OR
- New evidence available that will likely change the classification of a variant. For example, the identification of additional patient(s) with the same genetic variant or new functional evidence, 
AND
- Where either, there is new clinical information related to the patient or their family, or sufficient time has passed that there may be additional published evidence or knowledge, that could result in a change to the classification of the variant. 

Variant Re-interpretation must be treated as a new test request (WGS and Non-WGS) where there is no sample allocated, based on re-interpretation of existing sequenced data and the generation of a new report once re-interpretation is complete. Existing or old data must not be lost or overwritten in the event a new there is a new re-interpretation request.
