Cascade testing may be defined as the positive result of a singleton test triggering the need for family members to be tested by a requester. For example, in the instance of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (R134), a positive result of the test will guide the management for the patient and their family members. 

Cascade Testing is recorded on a rare disease test request order as the “Reason for Testing- Carrier or Predictive/ Pre-symptomatic.” Each cascade test is treated as a new test request and will be sent to the GLH with a sample(s).
