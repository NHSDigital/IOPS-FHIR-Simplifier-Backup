# {{variable:issue}}

The Genomics Composition is currently pending Clinical and Technical Assurance of the base UKCore resource. Once this profile becomes active in UKCore its suitability for use and need for profiling within Genomics will be assessed. 

The profile for the UKCore-Bundle is provided below for completeness.

Compositions within Genomics will be limited to documents generated by the central broker for capturing snapshots of Test orders and results in order to maintain historical accuracy, as per the {{pagelink:DocumentReference-generate}} OperationDefinition. These will typically form the first entry of a Document Bundle and as such will not be exposed via their own endpoint, nor allow creates,reads or updates from client systems on the resource itself.

**Usage of the Compostion resource and generation of documents is pending internal review**
