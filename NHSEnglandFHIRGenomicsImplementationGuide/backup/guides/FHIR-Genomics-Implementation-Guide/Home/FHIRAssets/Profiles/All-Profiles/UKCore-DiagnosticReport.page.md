## StructureDefinition {{variable:issue}}

The  requirements of a specific Genomics DiagnosticReport is currently under review.

The draft profile is provided below for completeness.

Currently, only requirements for initial Pathology reports, provided with a test order, have been reviewed. DiagnosticReports containing the results of genomic testing are expected to be attached/provided as PDF documents during the alpha phase of the GMS development programme. 

It is expected structured DiagnosticReports will mimic the structure proposed within the [HL7 International Genomic Reporting IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/index.html), though customizations for use within the UK still need to be investigated.

Genomic DiagnosticReports which have been updated post submission SHALL be accompanied by Provenance resources, referencing the DiagnosticReport which detail when the resource was changed, who made the change and why.
