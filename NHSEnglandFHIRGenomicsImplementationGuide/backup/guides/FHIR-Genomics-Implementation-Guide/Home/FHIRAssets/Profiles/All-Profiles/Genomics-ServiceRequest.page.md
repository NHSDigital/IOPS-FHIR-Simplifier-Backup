<a name="extension:additionalContact"></a>
#### extension:additionalContact
Extension used for recording additional personnel who should be contacted regarding questions related to a test order. This is separate from the requester or reporting address.

The additional contact SHOULD be a reference to a PractitionerRole resource wherever possible and SHALL contain contact details for the practitioner.

Additionally, where are there multiple practitioners involved in providing care who need to be listed as contacts, the contact details for each practitioner (or service) SHOULD be specified through additional additionalContact entries.
```json
{
    "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-AdditionalContact",
    "valueReference": {
        "reference": "PractitionerRole/PractitionerRole-AdditionalContact-Example"
    }
},
```

<a name="extension:coverage"></a>
#### extension:coverage
SHALL be present for Genomic Order Management test orders. Extension for recording how work against the test order is being funded. The ValueSet bound to this extension is currently under review by the NHS England Genomics Informatics Working Advisory Group and subject to change.
```json
{
    "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-Coverage",
    "valueCoding": {
        "system": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/CodeSystem/UKCore-FundingCategory",
        "code": "nhs",
        "display": "NHS"
    }
}
```

<a name="identifier"></a>
#### identifier
Automatically assigned by the central service, though source systems MAY provide a local identifier for tracking within their own system, in which case the central order number is appended to the identifiers array.
```json
    "identifier":  [
        {
            "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/GMSOrder",
            "value": "ROA43728"
        }
    ],
```

<a name="basedOn"></a>
#### basedOn
SHALL reference a parent request where this ServiceRequest is based on a previous request, e.g. in the case of reanalysis and cascade testing, or Germline Late tests in the Tumour First/Germline Late scenario.
```json
"basedOn":  [
        {
            "reference": "ServiceRequest/ServiceRequest-NonWGSTestOrderForm-FatherOfFayMutlow-Example"
        }
    ],
```

<a name="status"></a>
#### status
SHALL be provided. ServiceRequests SHOULD be marked as 'draft' until submitted, after which they will be marked as 'active' automatically by the central GMS system. 

A ServiceRequest may be marked as 'on-hold' if work against it cannot continue temporarily, e.g. due to certain prerequisite information not being provided. A ServiceRequest SHOULD be marked as 'revoked' if cancelled, either by the lab performing work against the order or at the request of the requesting clinician, though in each case a Provenance resource SHALL be provided to capture why the state change has occurred. The requesting clinician may also mark the ServiceRequest as entered-in-error, though implications for work already in progress needs to be investigated further.

A ServiceRequest SHOULD only be marked as completed by the requesting clinician upon receipt and review of the resulting DiagnosticReport.

For the full list of expected/supported ServiceRequest statuses, please see the table below: 

|Status|Description|Genomic workflow usage|
|--|--|--|
|Draft|The request has been created but is not yet complete or ready for action.|Saved but not submitted to central service|
|Active|The request is in force and ready to be acted upon.|Submitted to central service|
|On Hold|The request (and any implicit authorization to act) has been temporarily withdrawn but is expected to resume in the future.|Issue with progressing of task but the order is recoverable (a Task fulfilling this ServiceRequest has been marked as on-hold)|
|Revoked|The request (and any implicit authorization to act) has been terminated prior to the known full completion of the intended actions. No further activity should occur.|Unrecoverable issue with order (Task fulfilling the ServiceRequest has been marked as Failed and the requesting clinician has been unable to address the failure)|
|Completed|The activity described by the request has been fully performed. No further activity will occur.|Completed order, marked by requestor once DiagnosticReport is received and accepted|
|Entered in Error|This request should never have existed and should be considered 'void'. (It is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be "revoked" rather than "entered-in-error".).|Should not be used|
|Unknown|The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this request. Note: This concept is not to be used for "other" - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source system does not know which.|Should not be used|

```json
"status": "active",
```

<a name="intent"></a>
#### intent
SHALL be provided. ServiceRequests SHOULD be marked as 'order' unless they have been raised by a lab in response to an existing ServiceRequest, in which case they SHOULD be marked as 'reflex-order'. For reflex orders, the ServiceRequest.basedOn field SHALL be populated with the original ServiceRequest, for traceability.
```json
"intent": "order",
```

<a name="category"></a>
#### category
ServiceRequests SHOULD use the [Genomics Sequencing Category](https://simplifier.net/resolve?scope=fhir.r4.ukcore.stu3.currentbuild@0.0.6-pre-release&filepath=package/ValueSet-UKCore-GenomeSequencingCategory.json) ValueSet when categorising the test order in order to aid analytics (e.g. PLCM). This list is pending review from the Informatics Working Advisory Group, after which a full list of possible categorisations will be finalised.
```json
"category":  [
        {
            "coding":  [
                {
                    "system": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/CodeSystem/UKCore-GenomeSequencingCategory",
                    "code": "rare-disease-non-wgs",
                    "display": "Rare Disease - Non-WGS"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
```

<a name="priority"></a>
#### priority
ServiceRequests marked as urgent (i.e. not routine) SHOULD populate the extension:priorityReason with why an urgent test is being requested. This SHOULD ideally be coded using SNOMED CT concepts. Multiple priorityReason extensions are allowed within a single ServiceRequest in order to aid post-coordination.
```json
"priority": "urgent",
"_priority": {
        "extension" : [ 
            {
                "url" : "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/StructureDefinition/Extension-UKCore-PriorityReason",
                "valueCodeableConcept" : {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
                            "code": "722480002",
                            "display": "Chemotherapy started"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
```

For the purposes of Genomic Test Ordering, the doNotPerform field SHALL NOT be used. All ServiceRequests requests received by the system will be assumed to be orders for services/testing.

<a name="code"></a>
#### code
SHALL be provided. Code SHOULD contain the CI or CITT Test Directory code, currently available at https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/. There is currently no CodeSystem or queryable API for retrieving codes but work to address this is underway within the NHS England Genomics Unit.
```json
"code": {
        "coding":  [
            {
                "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/England-GenomicTestDirectory",
                "code": "R67.2",
                "display": "Monogenic hearing loss"
            }
        ]
    },
```

<a name="orderDetail"></a>
#### orderDetail
If multiple codes are being requested within one Test Order, these SHOULD be represented using the 'orderDetail' field, with the main indication captured using the 'code' field above. If completely separate pathways/samples etc. are required for processing against the codes, it is expected these would be requested via multiple ServiceRequests instead of a single ServiceRequest with multiple orderDetail codes. The exact cut-off for when orderDetail vs. multiple ServiceRequest should be used is still being investigated. 
An appropriate code(Panel codes) SHOULD come from the following NamingSystem: {{pagelink:England-GenomicTestPanelCode}}
```json
"orderDetail": [
    {
        "coding":  [
            {
                "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/England-GenomicTestDirectory",
                "code": "R67.1",
                "display": "Monogenic hearing loss"
            }
        ]
    }
],
```

<a name="subject"></a>
#### subject
SHALL be provided. Reference to the associated Patient. This MAY be through a resource reference if the ID on the central service is known (or provided within the transaction bundle) or through NHS number where this is known and has been traced through PDS
```json
"subject": {
        "reference": "Patient/Patient-MeirLieberman-Example",
        "identifier": {
            "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number",
            "value": "9449307873"
        }
    },
```

<a name="occurrence"></a>
#### occurrence\[x\]
If a result is required by a specific date, this MAY be indicated though occurrenceDateTime, though there is no guarantee from the GMS that the ServiceRequest will be processed in the time frame specified.
```json
"occurrenceDateTime": "2023-08-25",
```

<a name="authoredOn"></a>
#### authoredOn
SHALL be populated by the client upon submission, either manually by the user or automatically by the system integrating with the central GMS.
```json
"authoredOn": "2023-08-05",
```

<a name="requester"></a>
#### requester
SHALL be populated on all ServiceRequests submitted to the central GMS. This SHALL reference a PractitionerRole resource also submitted to the system (either within a single transaction or previously POSTed).
```json
"requester": {
        "reference": "PractitionerRole/PractitionerRole-GeneSmithENT-Example"
    },
```

<a name="performer"></a>
#### performer
Allows a requester to assign processing of the ServiceRequest to a particular organization (e.g. a remote GLH). The performer field SHOULD be populated with the ODS code for the managing organization/GLH. 

In the future state, ServiceRequests may be kept open, by not specifying a performer, allowing them to be picked up by the local GLH or otherwise routed based on by test routing (TBC). 
```json
"performer": [
        {
            "identifier": {
                "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code",
                "value": "RGT01"
            }
        }
    ]
```

<a name="reasonCode"></a>
#### reasonCode
reasonCode SHOULD be populated with the type of request being ordered e.g. Diagnostic, Carrier, Predictive, Stored DNA etc. The final list of applicable codes which can be selected is still under review. It is expected that a fixed list of SNOMED CT codes will be permissible, to allow appropriate categorisation by the central service.

This mapping is currently under review as the CI/CITT code is also technically the reason/indication for testing.
```json
"reasonCode":  [
        {
            "coding":  [
                {
                    "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
                    "code": "103693007",
                    "display": "Diagnostic procedure"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
```
<a name="reasonReference"></a>
#### reasonReference
Reference SHOULD be associated to the primary condition being tested for.
i.e,

```json
"reasonReference": {
        "reference": "Condition/Condition-LungTumor-Example"
    },
```

<a name="supportingInfo"></a>
#### supportingInfo
Any clinical information provided about the patient for whom the testing is being requested SHALL be referenced though the supportingInfo field, to ensure all the information relevant to the ServiceRequest can be easily retrieved. This includes Observations, Conditions, Procedures, FamilyMemberHistories etc.

This also includes resources related to family members included as part of testing (consultands), e.g. in Duo/Trio scenarios. In this instance, RelatedPerson resource references SHALL be added to the supportingInfo array, as well as any clinical resources related to these individuals. This is to ensure the number of participants for a given test can be calculated correctly, e.g. through counting the number of RelatedPerson resources referenced from ServiceRequest.supportingInfo plus the subject of the ServiceRequest itself (the proband).

For WGS testing, where Records of Discussion are required in order to process the test, Consent resources SHOULD also be added to the supportingInfo array once available.
```json
"supportingInfo":  [
        {
            "reference": "Observation/Observation-DiseaseStatus-Example"
        },
        {
            "reference": "Observation/Observation-GenomicEthnicity-Example"
        },
        {
            "reference": "Observation/Observation-NoPregnancy-Example"
        },
        {
            "reference": "FamilyMemberHistory/FamilyMemberHistory-NonConsanguinousUnion-Example"
        },
        {
            "reference": "Observation/Observation-NoTransplant-Example"
        },
        {
            "reference": "Observation/Observation-NoTransfusion-Example"
        },
        {
            "reference": "Condition/Condition-HearingLoss-Example"
        }
    ],
```

<a name="specimen"></a>
#### specimen
ServiceRequests for reanalysis, where the required samples already exist, SHOULD reference these samples through the specimen field. Where samples need to be collected to support testing, these SHOULD instead reference the ServiceRequest, through Specimen.request (i.e. the service request has prompted collection of the sample), **and SHOULD also be referenced from within ServiceRequest.supportingInfo as per the guidance above (pending review)**. The referenced Specimen resources SHOULD either be contained within the test order transaction bundle or already exist on the central GMS.
```json
"specimen": [
        {
            "reference": "Specimen/Specimen-BloodSerum-Example"
        }
    ],
```

<a name="note"></a>
#### note
Any information which cannot be readily be structured SHOULD be entered into the note field, though prolific use of the field to capture clinical information which better fits in level 3/4 FHIR resources is discouraged.
```json
"note":  [
        {
            "text": "No family history of genomic testing"
        }
    ]
```

<a name="relevantHistory"></a>
#### relevantHistory
ServiceRequests which have been updated post submission SHOULD reference Provenance resources which detail when the resource was changed, who made the change and why.
```json
"relevantHistory":  [
        {
            "reference": "Provenance/Provenance-ServiceRequestUpdate-Example"
        }
    ]
```
