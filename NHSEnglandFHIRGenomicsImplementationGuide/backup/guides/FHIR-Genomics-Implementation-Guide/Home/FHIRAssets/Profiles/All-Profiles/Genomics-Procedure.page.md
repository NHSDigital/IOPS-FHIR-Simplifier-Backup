## {{page-title}}

Used for detailing information on procedures the patient has had performed, to aid interpretation of Genomic test results.

Assertion of an absence of a procedure being performed SHOULD be recorded using an Observation resource, as described in {{pagelink:Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/Profiles/Genomics-Observation.page.md}}

At a minimum, Procedure resources are expected to contain the status, code, subject and performedDateTime, though additional information conforming to the FHIR profile below MAY be included if relevant.

<a name="status"></a>
#### status
Status SHALL use the codes recommended in the base Procedure resource, appropriately tagging procedures as having been completed or in-progress etc. depending on the actual status of the procedure.
```json
"status": "completed",
```

<a name="code"></a>
#### code
SNOMED CT coding is preferred, though alternative codings MAY be provided subject to review of the Coding system by the NHS England Genomics Unit.
```json
"code": {
        "coding":  [
            {
                "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
                "code": "23719005",
                "display": "Transplantation of bone marrow"
            }
        ]
    },
```

<a name="subject"></a>
#### subject
Reference to the associated Patient. This MAY be through a resource reference if the ID on the central service is known (or provided within the transaction bundle) or through NHS number where this is known and has been traced through PDS.
```json
"subject": {
        "reference": "Patient/Patient-MeirLieberman-Example",
        "identifier": {
            "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number",
            "value": "9449307873"
        }
    },
```

<a name="performed"></a>
#### performed\[x\]
performed SHOULD be provided wherever possible, using the appropriate data type, to aid in interpretation of Genomic test results.
```json
"performedDateTime": "2020-01-19"
```
