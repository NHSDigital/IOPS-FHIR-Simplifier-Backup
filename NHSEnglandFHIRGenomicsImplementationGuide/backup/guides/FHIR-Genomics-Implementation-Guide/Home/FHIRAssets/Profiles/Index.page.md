## {{page-title}}

The IG pages for the customised resources profiled for use in Genomics are listed below. These pages include the base profiles, any further customised 'constraint' profiles, indicating preferred cardinality for specific elements, as well as additional guidance for population of these resources within a Genomic Test Ordering context.

The rest of the profiles supported within Genomics are listed in {{pagelink:Home/FHIRAssets/CapabilityStatements}}, which include profiles from NHS England, UKCore and HL7 International. The packages containing these profiles have been added as dependencies within this IG.
