No custom search parameters have been defined for genomics as of publication but it expected search parameters for searching ServiceRequests and Diagnostic reports will need to be added, pending requirements gathering.

The list of common search parameters to be supported by the central GMS infrastructure are listed in the {{pagelink:Home/FHIRAssets/CapabilityStatements/Instance.page.md}} CapabilityStatement page.
