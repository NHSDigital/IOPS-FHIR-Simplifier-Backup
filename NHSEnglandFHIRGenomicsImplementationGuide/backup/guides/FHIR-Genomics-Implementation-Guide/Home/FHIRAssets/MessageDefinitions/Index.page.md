The MessageDefinitions created specifically for use in Genomics for fully specifying initial Test Orders and returning Genomic Reports are listed below. The use of messages vs. RESTful interactions within the Genomic Medicine Service is currently being reviewed. As such, the resources listed below are subject to change.

**Currently, the Central service is adopting a RESTful approach to resource interaction, meaning test order bundles are expected to be transactions composed of a series of individual operations, as opposed to messages. As such the below MessageDefinitions are provided for information only, for users to confirm which resources are expected within a given interaction.**
