The CodeSystems created specifically for use in Genomics are listed below. Some of the CodeSystems listed may still be in draft and pending further changes once requirements for the GMS have been finalised.

Codes for requestable entities (Test Directory codes) are dependent upon the digitisation of the test directory. This is treated as a separate project.
