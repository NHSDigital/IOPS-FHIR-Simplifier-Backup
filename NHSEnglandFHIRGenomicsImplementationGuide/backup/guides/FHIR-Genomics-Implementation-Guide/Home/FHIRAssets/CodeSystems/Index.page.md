The CodeSystems created specifically for use in Genomics are listed below. Some of the CodeSystems listed may still be in draft and pending further changes once requirements for the GMS have been finalised.

Codes for requestable entities (Test Directory codes) are dependent upon the digitisation of the test directory. This is treated as a separate project. 

By default, the central Genomic Order Management Broker will validate all CodeSystems included within the Genomics IG. It will also validate core HL7 CodeSystems, SNOMED CT codes and HPO codes (with the system http://human-phenotype-ontology.org) against the UK OntoServer. All other codes, from unknown CodeSystem, will not be validated against.
