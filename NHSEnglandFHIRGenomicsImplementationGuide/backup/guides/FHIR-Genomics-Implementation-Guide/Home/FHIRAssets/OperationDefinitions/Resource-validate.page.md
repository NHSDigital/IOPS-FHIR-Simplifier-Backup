## {{page-title}}
An operation to support validation of resources against a GraphDefinition. This OperationDefinition is an extension to the Resource-validate operation (please see the deifinition for this operation to determine functionality for the base input/output parameters).

Use of this operation SHALL invoke FHIR validation (structural validation), Ontology Server validation (semantic validation) and Business Rules/Genomic MDS validation (business validation) by default.

This Operation is intended to support two specific use cases:

1. To allow validation of resources before submission/creation on the central order management broker, e.g. in the case of a client/front-end system for constructing an order form, allowing display of validation issues to the user.

2. To allow downstream systems to validate or check test orders for warnings, e.g. omitted items marked as Mandatory in the Genomic Test Order MDS, allowing these systems to assess validity before injecting resources into their own pipelines.
