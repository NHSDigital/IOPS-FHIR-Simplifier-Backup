With many different methods of implementing patient record interoperability, there is a need for reform to develop a standardised and consistent method to get and update patient records.  

However, the need for a standardised approach to digitally requesting and updating patient records remains a challenge. While initiatives like Transfer of Care, PODAC Digital Medicines, and GP Connect initially aimed for a unified solution using ITK3 and MESH, they ultimately diverged, leading to inconsistencies in data models, payloads, validation, and overall approach.

Looking ahead, we must consider strategically how to expand upon the current interoperability offerings and provide support to all health services in England. This requires a forward-thinking approach that anticipates the evolving needs of the healthcare landscape and ensures the long-term sustainability and adaptability of clinical records management.

## Background

There are currently many ways to access data from different supplier systems and care settings. There is now a need to explore developments to the APIs to not only conform to the latest technology and platforms, but to focus on the concept of single patient record. 

Other factors include:

- Support patients treated in multiple care settings
- Greater need to access the whole patient data
- Extend the reach of suppliers to more markets
- Attract and influence intuitive and innovative products
- Update current standards and capabilities to reflect future innovations/challenges
- Minimise the number of ways you can access a patient record

## Vision

A single API for reading and writing patient activity across the NHS would offer seamless data exchange between healthcare providers, eliminating the need for complex integrations and reducing administrative delays. This unified platform would promote real-time patient record updates, enabling informed decision-making, efficient care coordination, and ultimately improved health outcomes.
