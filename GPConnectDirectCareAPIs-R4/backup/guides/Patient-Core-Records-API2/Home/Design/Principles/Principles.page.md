### Architecture principles

The API would conform to the following NHS England Architecture principles:

__Deliver Sustainable Services__

A single API would enable the use of efficient interactions where a solution would meet many different requirements with regards to data transfer. It would also be scalable to accept increasing demand. 

Adopting latest protocol ensures efficient and quick data movement minimising the need to store data in additional repositories.

__Internet First__

RESTful interactions would utilise the HTTP protocol and can support multiple data formats.
Use open standards to ensure the API can integrate easily with other systems, reducing redundancy.
Promote reuse of existing APIs to avoid duplicating efforts.

__Adopt appropriate cyber security standards__

Integrating the API Management platform would ensure appropriate security measures are in place for data transfer

__Use Platforms__

Digital services should adopt open data and technology standards.
Would be integrated into the APIM platform giving access to other central services. Also, would conform to the FHIR UK Core standard.


__Interoperability with open data and technology standards__

UK Core specification adheres to the HL7 R4 FHIR standard, positioning it as the benchmark for any forthcoming developments under the FHIR standard. The standard is accessible and allows new innovators to collaborate and create solutions using the standard.
