All traffic using the API would need to go through NHS England API management platform which would provide the forwarding and also the authentication.

Two types of users can access the user-restricted APIs: 

healthcare workers - authenticated using NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2) 
patients - authenticated using NHS login
