The following components have been suggested to achieve the interoperability outlined in the document.

### FHIR
Technical standard – To support the UK approved technical standard of FHIR R4, represented through UK Core.

### Data model
A data model helps in standardising the way data is represented and stored. This consistency is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that data is handled uniformly across the system. An agreed data model is required to allow the relevant data to be exchanged between systems successfully.

### Transport mechanism – RESTful
RESTful services use standard protocols such as HTTP, which are supported by a wide range of platforms and technologies. This promotes interoperability and allows different systems to communicate seamlessly. To create a healthcare interop ecosystem that incorporates the RESTful protocol (where appropriate) would make systems more accessible and integrations would be easier.

### API platform
To utilise the API Management platform which would offer integrations to central services as well as an authorisation server that would authenticate and authorise the calling application. The platform would also provide the logging and auditing facilities.
