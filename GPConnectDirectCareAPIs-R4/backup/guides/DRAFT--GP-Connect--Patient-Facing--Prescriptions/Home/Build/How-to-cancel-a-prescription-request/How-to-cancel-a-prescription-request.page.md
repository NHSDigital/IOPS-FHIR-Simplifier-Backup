In order to cancel a prescription request the patient would first have to retrieve their prescription requests in order to view the in-flight requests.

<div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--bg-light-blue nhsd-!t-margin-bottom-6 nhsd-t-body">
<p><b>Note</b> - reorder requests can only be cancelled <u>before</u> they have been actioned. This means it must not send a request to cancel anything further forward than a status of <u>Requested</u>. Any status further on than this will return an error.
