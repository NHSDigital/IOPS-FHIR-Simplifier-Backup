If a patient wishes to track their prescription requests this can be done easily by doing a singular call using the patient's NHS Number to GET /Task?patient=`{NHS Number}`.

There are extra parameters available such as date and status should these need to be refined further.

Details surrounding these extra parameters can be found [here.](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/gp-connect-patient-facing-prescriptions-fhir#get-/Task)
