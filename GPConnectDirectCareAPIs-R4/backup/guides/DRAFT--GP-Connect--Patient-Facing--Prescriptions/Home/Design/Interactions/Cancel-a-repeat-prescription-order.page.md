Allows the patient to cancel an unactioned prescription order which has a status of 'requested'. Prescriptions hold this status until their practitioner has reviewed and actioned the prescription order within the practitioner system. Once the status has moved beyond 'requested' the patient is unable to cancel the order via their patient facing application and is informed to contact their practitioner directly.
