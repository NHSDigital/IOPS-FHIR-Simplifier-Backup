Increasingly patients want to be able to manage their prescriptions without interacting with practitioners and relying on paper prescriptions. Patient-facing Services, in combination with the Prescriptions API, and practitioner systems, allows patients to manage electronic prescription orders and send them to the practitioner directly. This enables patients to create, track, and cancel their prescription orders at any time of day no matter where they are located.
