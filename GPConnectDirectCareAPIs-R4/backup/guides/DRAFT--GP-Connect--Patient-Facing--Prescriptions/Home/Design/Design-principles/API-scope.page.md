The scope of the API is to enable the ability for patients using patient-facing applications (like the NHS App) to:

- order a repeat prescription

- view all medication including acute and repeat medications, both current and historic

- cancel an unactioned order for a repeat prescription

- check the status of a prescription order

- view active prescription requests

- order an electronic repeat prescription as a one off to a pharmacy other than the patient's nominated pharmacy
